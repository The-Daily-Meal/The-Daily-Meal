        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p><span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-2">Ice cream</span> is a <span class="mention food ingredient" about="dairy" id="ic2-3">frozen dairy</span> product made by freezing the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-4">ice cream</span> mix with agitation. It is composed of a mixture of food ingredients like <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic2-5">milk products</span>, <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic2-6">sweetening materials</span>, <span clasS="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-7">stabilizers</span>, <span class="mention component" about="color" id="ic2-8">colors</span>, <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-9">flavors</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="egg" id="ic2-10">egg products</span>. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-11">Ice cream</span> had its origins in <span class="mention place" about="Europe" id="ic2-12" data-wikidata-id="Q46" data-label="Europe">Europe</span> and was introduced later to the <span class="mention place" about="USA" id="ic2-13" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span> where it developed into an industry. It is widely believed that <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-14">ice cream</span> evolved from <span class="mention food" about="icedBeverage" id="ic2-15">iced beverages</span> and <span class="mention food" about="waterIce" id="ic2-16">water ices</span>. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-17">Ice cream</span> probably came to the <span class="mention place" about="USA" id="ic2-18" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span> with the early English settlers. In <time datetime="1851">1851</time>, the first wholesale <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-19">ice cream</span> industry in the <span class="mention place" about="USA" id="ic2-20" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span> was established in <span class="mention place" about="Baltimore" id="ic2-21" data-wikidata-id="Q5092" data-label="Baltimore">Baltimore, Maryland</span>. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-22">Ice cream</span> plants were then established in <span class="mention place" about="NY" id="ic2-23" data-wikidata-id="Q60">New York</span>, <span class="mention place" about="stLouis" id="ic2-24" data-wikidata-id="Q38022" data-label="St. Louis">St. Louis</span>, <span class="mention place" about="chicago" id="ic2-25" data-wikidata-id="Q1297" data-label="Chicago">Chicago</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Washington" id="ic2-26"  data-wikidata-id="Q61" data-label="Washington">Washington</span>, and <span class="mention place" about="Cincinnati" id="ic2-27" data-wikidata-id="Q43196" data-label="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</span>. The development of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic2-28">condensed and dried milks</span> and the introduction of the <span class="mention component" about="pasteurizer" id="ic2-29">pasteurizer</span> and <span class="mention component" about="homogenizer" id="ic2-30">homogenizer</span>, improved freezers, and other preserving equipments accompanied the growth of this industry after <time datetime="1900">1900</time>. The <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-31">ice cream</span> soda was introduced in <time datetime="1879">1879</time>, and <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-32">ice cream cone</span> and <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-33">Eskimo Pie</span> were introduced in <time datetime="1904">1904</time> and <time datetime="1921">1921</time>, respectively.</p>
        <p>Global per capita consumption of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-34">ice cream</span> and related products is presented in <a href="#ic2-table1">Table 1</a>. The US <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-35">ice cream</span> market in <time datetime="2007">2007</time> was $23 billion. The global value of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-36">ice cream</span> industry is US$59 billion, growing on an average by 4% per annum with a growth rate of 7–9%. More than 90% of American households purchase <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-37">ice cream</span>. Global market share, according to point of manufacture/consumption, take-home, impulse, or artisanal products, is shown in <a href="#ic2-table2">Table 2</a>. The take-home category is defined as grocery store purchases and home consumption, the impulse category is categorized by hand-held, single-serving eat-on-the-spot products (sometimes referred to as novelty products), and the artisanal category is defined as being manufactured at the site of purchase and consumption or sold directly by the manufacturer to the consumer (e.g., <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-38">ice cream</span> parlors and street vendors). There are very large differences globally, impacted in large part by the presence of home freezers.</p>
        <p><span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-39">Ice creams</span> are unique frozen food because they are consumed in the frozen state, usually as a scooped product or as a single-serving item, sometimes on a stick and often with other confectionery items. These products rely on a concomitant freezing and whipping process to establish the desired structure and texture. The manufacturing process for most of these products is similar. It involves the preparation of a liquid mix, which is prepared by blending the desired ingredients, followed by pasteurization, homogenization, and aging. It is followed by whipping and freezing this mix dynamically under high shear to soft, semi-frozen slurry. The <span class="mnetion component" about="flavour" id="ic2-510">flavoring ingredients</span> are then incorporated in this partially frozen mix. It is then placed in molds for desired shaping and packaging the product. It is further subject to freezing (hardening) under static, quiescent conditions. Swept-surface freezers are used for the first freezing step, while forced convection freezers, such as air blast tunnels or rooms, or plate-type conduction freezers are used for the second freezing step. A wide variety of ingredients are used to produce <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-40">ice creams</span>. Even any one kind of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-41">ice cream</span> can be made by combining the ingredients in any of several different combinations of ingredients. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-42">Ice cream</span> mix is the unfrozen mixture of the ingredients, consisting of all the components of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-43">ice cream</span> with the exception of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-511">air</span> and <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-512">flavoring materials</span>. The composition of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-44">ice cream</span> is usually expressed as a percentage of its constituents, for example, percentage of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-45">milk fat</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="msnf" id="ic2-46">milk solids-not-fat</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic2-47">sugar</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="egg" id="ic2-48">egg solids</span>, <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-49">stabilizers</span>, and the total solids.</p>

An account of composition of various <span class="mention food ingredient" about="dairy" id="ic2-60">frozen dairy</span> desserts is presented in <a href="#ic2-table3">Table 3</a>. The source of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-61">fat</span> that is derived from <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic2-62">milk</span> ingredients (e.g., <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic2-63">cream</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="butter" id="ic2-64">butter</span>) is common in <span class="mention place" about="NorthAmerica" id="ic2-65" data-wikidata-id="Q49" data-label="North America">North America</span> and many other parts of the world, while <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-6200">fat</span> derived from nondairy sources (e.g., <span class="mention food ingredient" about="coconutOil" id="ic2-630">coconut oil</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="palmKernelOil" id="ic2-640">palm kernel oil</span>) is more common in parts of <span class="mention place" about="Europe" id="ic2-65" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span> and <span class="mention place" about="Asia" id="ic2-66" data-wikidata-id="Q48">Asia</span>. The triglycerides in <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-67">milk fat</span> have a wide melting range of 40 to - 40 &deg;C. Consequently, at refrigeration temperatures, there is always a combination of liquid and crystalline <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-68">fat</span> within the globules. The resulting solid–liquid ratio at freezer barrel temperatures is important for formation of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-69">ice cream</span> structure, as <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-70">crystalline fat</span> is required for partial coalescence. <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-71">Nondairy fat</span> sources must also be chosen to provide a suitable solid <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-72">fat</span> content.</p>

Whipping of <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic2-85">proteins</span> in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-86">ice cream</span> contributes to the formation of the initial <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-513">air</span> bubbles in the mix. Emulsification of <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic2-87">proteins</span> in the mix arises from their adsorption to <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-88">fat</span> globules due to homogenization. Viscosity of mix is enhanced due to water holding capacity of <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic2-89">proteins</span>, which imparts a desired body to the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-90">ice cream</span>, increases the meltdown time of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-91">ice cream</span>, and contributes to reduced iciness.</p>

        <p><span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic2-142">Sweeteners</span> improve the texture and palatability of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-143">ice cream</span>, impart sweet taste, and enhance flavors. They also lower the freezing point of the mixture, which imparts a measure of control over the temperature–hardness relationship. In determining the proper blend of <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic2-144">sweeteners</span> for an <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-145">ice cream</span> mix, the total solids required from the <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic2-146">sweeteners</span>, the sweetness factor of each <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic2-147">sugar</span>, and the combined freezing point depression of all <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic2-148">sugars</span> in solution (including <span class="mention component" about="lactose" id="ic2-149">lactose</span> from the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="dairy" id="ic2-150">dairy ingredients</span>) must be calculated to achieve the proper solids content, the appropriate sweetness level, and a satisfactory degree of hardness. The most common sweetening agent used is <span class="mention component sweetener" about="sucrose" id="ic2-151">sucrose</span>. It provides sweetness, depresses freezing point, affects freezing performance, affects body and texture, enhances flavor, and contributes bulk or total solids and impacts on economics. Generally, the equivalent of 15% <span class="mention component sweetener" about="sucrose" id="ic2-152">sucrose</span> is considered optimal sweetness in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-153">ice cream</span>. Substitute <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic2-154">sweeteners</span> derived from <span class="mention food ingredient" about="glucoseSyrup" id="ic2-155">starch hydrolysate syrup (glucose syrup)</span> for all or a portion of the <span class="mention component sweetener" about="sucrose" id="ic2-156">sucrose</span> can also be used as it is relatively cheaper. <span class="mention food ingredient" about="glucoseSyrup" id="ic2-157">Glucose syrups</span> impart greater smoothness by contributing to a firmer and chewy body, provide better meltdown characteristics, bring out enhanced fruit flavors, and reduce heat shock potential that improves the shelf life of the finished product.

The mechanism of action of <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-181">stabilizers</span> in enhancing frozen stability is related primarily to its effect on the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-182">ice</span> and unfrozen serum phases. Stabilized <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-183">ice cream</span> has smaller <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-184">ice</span> crystals than unstabilized <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-185">ice cream</span> after storage at fluctuating temperatures. Usually, <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-186">stabilizers</span> are used at 0.1–0.5% levels in the mix, but the actual amount depends on the type and strength of the <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-187">stabilizer</span>, total solids and <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-188">fat</span> level of the mix, duration and temperature of storage of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-189">ice cream</span>, and the method of pasteurization. High-fat and high-total solid mixes require lower levels of <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-190">stabilizers</span>. More <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-191">stabilizer</span> is needed for <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-192">ice cream</span> that is stored for a long period of time or if the temperature fluctuation during storage is frequent.</p>

        <p><span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-194">Emulsifiers</span> are sometimes integrated with the <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-1940">stabilizers</span> in proprietary blends, but their function and action are very different from the <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-195">stabilizers</span>. They exert their action on the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-196">fat</span> phase of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-197">ice cream</span>. These are surface-active agents. <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-198">Emulsifiers</span> facilitate the mixing of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-199">fat</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-200">water</span> because these molecules have two domains, one that likes <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-201">water</span> (hydrophilic) and another that likes <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-202">fat</span> (hydrophobic). When the hydrophobic part of a surfactant interacts with the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-203">fat</span>, the water-loving part of the molecule can interact with <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-204">water</span>, thus facilitating the suspension of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-205">fat</span> in <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-206">water</span>. Generally, mono- and diglycerides and ethoxylated esters of sorbitol (polysorbates) are the com monlyused <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-207">emulsifiers</span>. Mono- and diglycerides are derived from fatty acids and glycerol. Therefore, <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-208">emulsifiers</span> are fatty substances. They also show fatlike properties such as melting point and crystallinity, and they can be composed of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. The presence of <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-209">emulsifiers</span> in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-210">ice cream</span> leads to smoother texture and better shape retention while improving the ability of the mix to incorporate <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-211">air</span>. The mode of action of <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-212">emulsifiers</span> is related to their activity at the air–serum and fat–serum interfaces. At the fat–serum interface, they displace proteins from the surface of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-213">fat</span> globules, rendering the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-214">fat</span> globules more susceptible to partial coalescence and structure formation during the freezing and whipping process.</p>

      <div class="section" id="ic2-figuringTheMixSection">
        <h3>Figuring the Mix</h3>
        <p><span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-215">Ice cream</span> processing operations can be divided into two distinct stages: figuring the mix and freezing operations. Once a formula has been finalized, a recipe has to be created. Formulas specify composition of the desired mix in terms of percentages of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-216">fat</span>, <span class="mention component" about="msnf" id="ic2-217">MSNF</span>, <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic2-218">sweeteners</span>, <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-219">stabilizers</span>, and <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-220">emulsifiers</span>. A recipe calculates the weight and/or volumes of ingredients needed to meet the formula requirements. These calculations are called mix calculations. Mix calculations are essential for manufacturing consistent quality finished products. When composition of raw materials varies or the economics of ingredients changes, the recipe for making an <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-221">ice cream</span> mix has to change. Further, this change has to occur in a manner that the finished product composition is not altered. In some instances, changing regulatory definitions and health claims may necessitate manufacture of products to carefully defined specifications.</p>
        <p>Mix calculations are important in standardizing mixes prior to freezing. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-222">Ice cream</span> plants now use computer software programs to calculate the amounts of various ingredients to conform to required specifications of composition of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-223">ice cream</span> mix. However, for basic understanding, the fundamentals of the mix calculations are discussed here. Mix calculations can be performed by Pearson’s square, algebraic methods, and arithmetic methods. Pearson’s square is of limited utility; algebraic methods are complicated and involve the use of simultaneous equations and matrices. Arithmetic calculations are simpler and require fewer computations than algebraic methods.</p>
        <p>Figuring the mix consists of the following unit operations: combination and blending of ingredients, batch or continuous pasteurization, homogenization, and mix aging. Ingredients are usually preblended prior to pasteurization, regardless of the type of pasteurization system used. Blending of ingredients is relatively simple if all ingredients are in the liquid form, as automated metering pumps or tanks on load cells can be used. When dry ingredients are used, powders are added either through a pumping system under high velocity or through a liquefier that chops all ingredients as they are mixed with the liquid.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="ic2-pasteurizationSection">
        <h3>Pasteurization</h3>
        <p>It is designed to destruct pathogenic bacteria, if any are present. In addition, it serves a useful role in reducing the total bacterial load and in solubilizing some of the components (<span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic2-224">proteins</span> and <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-225">stabilizers</span>). Both batch and continuous (high-temperature short-time (HTST)) systems are in common use. In a batch pasteurization system, blending of the ingredients is done in large jacketed vats equipped with some means of heating, usually saturated steam or hot water. The product is then heated in the vat to at least 69 &deg;C and held for 30 min to satisfy legal requirements for pasteurization. This is necessary for the destruction of pathogenic bacteria. Various time–temperature combinations can be used, depending on the legal jurisdiction. Continuous pasteurization is usually per formed in an HTST heat exchanger following the blending of ingredients in a large, insulated feed tank. Regulations concerning time–temperature combinations for continuous pasteurization usually specify a minimum temperature of 80 &deg;C for at least 25 s.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="ic2-homogeneizationSection">
        <h3>Homogenization</h3>
        <p>Following pasteurization, the mix is homogenized using high pressures. It is responsible for the formation of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-228">fat</span> emulsion by forcing the hot mix through a small orifice under pressures of 15.5–18.9 MPa, depending on the mix composition. The resulting eight- to tenfold increase in the surface area of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-226">fat</span> globules is responsible in part for the formation of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-227">fat</span> globule membrane, composed of adsorbing materials attempting to lower the interfacial free energy of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-229">fat</span> globules. With single-stage homogenizers, <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-230">fat</span> globules tend to cluster as bare <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-231">fat</span> surfaces come together or adsorbed molecules are shared, especially in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-232">ice cream</span> mix. Therefore, a second homogenizing valve is frequently placed immediately after the first with applied back pressures of 3.4 MPa, allowing more time for surface adsorption to occur. The net effects of homogenization are in the production of smaller, more uniform <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-233">fat</span> droplet size, resulting in a greater stability of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-234">fat</span> droplets during aging, a better whipping ability, and a smoother, more uniform final product with a greater apparent richness.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="ic2-agingOfTheMixSection">
        <h3>Aging of the Mix</h3>
        <p>The time of 4 h or greater at 2–4 &deg;C is recommended for aging following mix processing prior to freezing. Aging is performed in insulated or refrigerated storage tanks, silos, etc. or in single walled tanks in chilled rooms, where valves and pipeline can also be kept cold. Aging allows hydration of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic2-235">milk</span> proteins and <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic2-236">stabilizers</span> (some viscosity increase occurs during the aging period), crystallization of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-237">fat</span> globules, and a membrane rearrangement to produce a smoother texture and better quality product. Nonaged mix exhibits a low viscosity, is very wet at extrusion from the dynamic freezer, and exhibits variable whipping abilities. The appropriate ratio of solid–liquid <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-238">fat</span> must be attained at this stage, a function of temperature and the triglyceride composition of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-239">fat</span> used, as a partially crystalline emulsion is needed for partial coalescence in the whipping and freezing step. <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic2-240">Emulsifiers</span> generally displace <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic2-241">milk</span> proteins from the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-242">fat</span> surface during the aging period. The whipping qualities of the mix are usually improved with aging. Mix temperatures should be maintained as low as possible without freezing.</p>

When the word ‘flavor’ is used in everyday parlance, we imply taste and olfaction. Taste compounds are sweet, salty, bitter, and sour. Generally, compounds imparting these tastes can be detected at levels of 0.01–0.5. Olfactory compounds (smelly stuff) are volatile and have thresholds in the parts per million to parts per trillion range. Threshold is defined as the minimum concentration that at least 50% of the population can detect. Threshold of aroma compounds are 10–10 million times less than taste compounds.</p>
        <p>Perception of aroma is affected by the composition, physical structure, and temperature of the food. Undesirable <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-245">flavors</span> are called off-<span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-246">flavors</span>. Off-<span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-247">flavors</span> affect the overall <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-248">flavors</span> qualities of the food. Deteriorative reactions are time-dependent and cumulative. Therefore, the length and conditions of storage have a profound influence on the perception of overall <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-249">flavors</span>. These deteriorative reactions occur in ingredients used in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-250">ice cream</span> manufacture. Therefore, careful attention should be paid to the quality of ingredients used in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-251">ice cream</span> manufacture.</p>

        <h3>Glass Transition Temperature</h3>
        <p>Temperature stability of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-252">ice cream</span> has focused on carbohydrate glass formation as a function of temperature. A glass is characterized as a metastable solid with a high viscosity. At the glass transition temperature, polymeric materials change from a viscoelastic liquid to an amorphous solid (glass) with an associated increase in viscosity. For <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-253">ice creams</span>, this temperature is defined as the glass transition temperature of a maximally freeze-concentrated solution. The interest in glassy state in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-254">ice creams</span> has increased steadily since the last 15 years. It is now well established that the glassy-state temperature influences the storage stability as above these temperatures, the solutions are unstable and reactive. Ice crystallization can also occur in this phase. Below the glass transient temperature, the materials become glossy and no molecular motion or chemical reaction occurs. The ice crystallization is prevented and the shelf life of the product is prolonged. Glass transition temperature for <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-255">ice cream</span> is -32 &deg;C. Storage of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-256">ice cream</span> at this low temperature to maintain the glassy state for enhanced stability is not practical.</p>

        <h3>Freezing Process</h3>
        <p>The process of freezing of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-257">ice cream</span> in simple words is the creation of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-258">ice</span> from <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-259">water</span> in the mix. Therefore, the only constituent of the mix being frozen is <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-260">water</span>. During the freezing process, the equilibrium between <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-261">water</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-262">ice</span> is altered. Freezing is facilitated by the removal of heat from a substance. In the old <span class="mention food ingredient" about="salt" id="ic2-263">salt</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-264">ice</span> machine, used prior to mechanical refrigeration, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id=2ic2-265>ice</span> served as the refrigerant and addition of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="salt" id="ic2-266">salt</span> lowered the freezing point of <span clasS="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-267">water</span>. The brine extracts heat from the mix. The mix temperature is lowered and the brine temperature increases. Brine is not a good refrigerant. With the advent of mechanical refrigeration, the use of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-268">ice</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="salt" id="ic2-269">salt</span> for freezing <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-270">ice cream</span> was relegated to a hobby status.</p>
        <p>Modern <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-271">ice cream</span> freezing consists of two distinct stages: (1) passing the mix through a swept-surface heat exchanger under high-shear conditions to promote extensive <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-272">ice</span> crystal nucleation and <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-273">air</span> incorporation and (2) freezing the pack aged <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-274">ice cream</span> under conditions that promote rapid freezing and formation of small <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-275">ice</span> crystals. The freezing and whipping process is one of the most important unit operations for the development of quality, palatability, and yield of finished product. Due to the incorporation of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-276">air</span>, foam is created. It leads to the formation of the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-277">ice</span> phase and the partial destabilization of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-278">fat</span> emulsion. The objective of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-279">ice cream</span> manufacturers is to produce <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-280">ice</span> crystals that are below the threshold of sensory detection at the time of consumption. This threshold has been suggested to be between 40 and 50 mm. Therefore, the freezing steps of the manufacturing process and the temperature profile throughout the distribution system are critical factors in meeting this objective. <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-281">Flavoring</span> and <span class="mention component" about="colorant" id="ic2-282">colorants</span> are added as desired to the mix prior to passing through the barrel freezer, and particulate <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic2-283">flavoring ingredients</span>, such as <span class="mention food ingredient" about="nut" id="ic2-284">nuts</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="fruit" id="ic2-285">fruits</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="candy" id="ic2-286">candy pieces</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="rippleSauces" id="ic2-287">ripple sauces</span>, can be added to the semifrozen product at the exit from the barrel freezer prior to packaging and hardening.</p>

      <div class="section" id="ic2-continuousFreezersSection">
        <h3>Continuous Freezers</h3>
        <p>Continuous freezers are commonly used in larger <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-288">ice cream</span> manufacturing plants where more than 500 gal (1875 l) of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-289">ice cream</span> per day may be manufactured. These freezers have larger capacities and can be operated continuously, ingredients can be added in-line, and packaging can be also automated. Also, continuous freezers make it possible to produce <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-290">ice cream</span> of different shapes through extrusion devices. Novelty extrusions, such as <span class="mention food" about="sandwich" id="ic2-291">sandwiches</span>, prefilled <span class="mention food" about="cone" id="ic2-292">cones</span> and <span class="mention food" about="cup" id="ic2-293">cups</span>, and <span class="mention food" about="cake" id="ic2-294">cakes</span>, are possible through the use of continuous freezers. The <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-295">ice cream</span> from a continuous freezer is smoother and creamier than a product from a batch freezer. This is because the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-296">ice</span> crystals formed in a continuous freezer are smaller and the <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-297">air</span> cells may also be more uniform. The <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-298">ice cream</span> exiting a continuous freezer is also generally colder than that coming out of a batch freezer. There are a number of different types of continuous <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-299">ice cream</span> freezers; some are vertical freezers, especially for smaller-scale operations; others are horizontal <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-300">ice cream</span> freezers. Regardless of whether the freezing cylinder is horizontal or vertical, all continuous freezers have a set of blades for scrapping the walls of the freezers. In a continuous freezer, a mixture of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-520">air</span> and the mix is introduced at one end and is progressively frozen until <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-301">ice cream</span> is discharged at the other end. The conveyance of the mixture of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-302">air</span> and the mix and the discharge of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-303">ice cream</span> may be facilitated by coordinated pumps in some models. Also, the newer models of freezers are equipped with microprocessor controls that monitor and control the discharge temperature of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-304">ice cream</span>, the viscosity of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-305">ice cream</span>, and the overrun of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-306">ice cream</span>. Further, these microprocessors can work in tandem with other downstream equipment such as ingredient feeders and packaging lines.</p>
        <p>These freezers dominate the commercial <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-307">ice cream</span> industry. In this type of process, <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-308">ice cream</span> mix is drawn from the flavoring tank into a scraped-surface heat exchanger, which is jacketed with a liquid, boiling refrigerant (usually ammonia; a chlorinated, fluorinated hydrocarbon (CFC) such as R-12, R-22, or R-502; or one of the newly developed CFC substitutes).</p>
        <p>A continuous freezer is usually operated under pressure, to minimize the volume of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-309">air</span> in the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-310">ice cream</span> and thus maximize heat transfer. <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-311">Air</span> bubbles expand rapidly when the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-312">ice cream</span> is drawn through the outlet valve to atmospheric pres sure. The introduction of low-temperature extrusion equipment has been a recent development in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-313">ice cream</span> freezing technology. This is a continuous-flow heat exchanger in the form of a screw extruder that reduces the temperature of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-314">ice cream</span> from the draw temperature of the barrel freezer, typically -5 &deg;C, to a range of -10 to -14 &deg;C. The <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-315">ice cream</span> passes at low shear through a twin-screw or single-screw design with a residence time of 1–2 min. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-316">Ice cream</span> that results from such processing shows much smaller <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-317">ice cream</span> and <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-318">air</span> bubble sizes, and the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-319">fat</span> is agglomerated into a structure that provides a creamy texture.</p>
        <p>When the product emerges from the low-temperature extruder, it is still pliable, so some particulates can be added to it, and it can be cut and packaged, but it sets up very quickly thereafter to a very firm consistency. Hence, the claim is made that low-temperature extrusion can replace the need for conventional hardening of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-320">ice cream</span>.</p>

      <div class="section" id="ic2-batchFreezersSection">
        <h3>Batch Freezers</h3>
        <p>Batch freezers are commonly used by small <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-321">ice cream</span> units that make <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-322">ice cream</span> on the premises. In batch freezers, a predetermined amount of mix is charged into the freezing chamber; refrigeration is turned on as is the agitation. Generally, the mix will occupy half of the barrel. The mix is agitated and whipped while being cooled. After some time, the mix begins to freeze, and when it achieves a certain consistency, it begins to incorporate <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-323">air</span>. Incorporation of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-324">air</span> in conjunction with the freezing stiffens the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-325">ice cream</span>. At this point, the refrigeration should be turned off and agitation continued for some additional period of time. When the desired overrun is achieved, the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-326">ice cream</span> is discharged from the barrel with the agitator mechanism still on.</p>
        <p>Just prior to discharge of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-327">ice cream</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="fruit" id="ic2-328">fruits</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="nut" id="ic2-329">nuts</span> can be added to the barrel, but the preferred method of addition of particulate inclusions is to fold them into the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-330">ice cream</span> as they are being discharged from the barrel. Once this process is complete, the next batch of mix can be charged into the freezer barrel and the process repeated.</p>
        <p>The batch freezer differs considerably from the continuous systems described in the preceding text. The barrel of a batch swept-surface heat exchanger is jacketed with refrigerant and contains a set of dashers and scraper blades inside the barrel. It is filled to about one-half volume with the liquid mix. Barrel volumes usually range from 2 to 12 l. The freezing unit and agitators are then activated, and the product remains in the barrel for sufficient time to achieve the desired degree of over run and stiffness. Whipping increases with time and cannot exceed the amount that will fill the barrel with the product (i.e., 100% overrun when starting half full). Batch freezers are used in smaller operations where it is desirable to run individual flavored mixes on a small scale or to retain an element of the ‘homemade’-style manufacturing process.</p>
        <p>The formation of the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-331">ice</span> phase during the continuous freezing stage is responsible in part for the structure and texture of the final product. The crystallization of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-332">water</span> to <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-333">ice</span> involves two major steps: nucleation and crystal growth. Nucleation occurs at the wall of the heat exchanger during start-up. After start-up, the continual scraping action of the blades acts as a seeding mechanism, by providing a source of tiny crystals into the bulk where they grow.</p>

        <h3>Overrun in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-334">Ice Cream</span></h3>
        <p>Incorporation of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-335">air</span> into <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-336">ice cream</span>, termed the overrun, occurs at this stage. Some overrun is necessary to produce desirable body and texture. Two main types of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-337">air</span> incorporation systems are used in continuous freezers. In older systems, the pump configuration resulted in a vacuum either at the pump itself or on the mix line entering the pump. <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-338">Air</span> was then incorporated through a spring-loaded, controllable needle valve. Newer types of freezers use compressed <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-339">air</span>, which is injected into the mix. This type of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-340">air</span> handling system allows for <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-341">air</span> filtration (0.65 &mu;m micropore filter) prior to admission into the mix.</p>
        <p>Following aeration, the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-342">water</span> in the mix is partially frozen as the mix and <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-343">air</span> combination passes through the barrel of the heat exchanger. <span clasS="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-344">Ice</span> forms on the inside wall of the heat exchanger from the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-345">water</span> in the mix, resulting in a freeze concentration of the dissolved solutes. Rotating knife blades are responsible for continually scraping this frozen mix off the surface of the heat exchanger wall and mixing it into the bulk flow of freeze-concentrated liquid mix, where these tiny <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-346">ice</span> crystals grow. The dasher keeps the product agitated inside the barrel and provides a more homogeneous mixture of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-347">ice</span> and freeze-concentrated liquid. Residence time for mix through the annulus of the freezer varies from 0.4 to 2 min, although some products may remain for much longer times; especially with open cage dashers, freezing rates can vary from 5 to 27 &deg;C min<sup>-1</sup>, and a draw temperature of -6 &deg;C can easily be achieved.</p>

Rapid initial freezing is essential to set up as many crystal nuclei as possible so that during the maturation or growth stage, their size stays small. In the same context, rapid hardening is also necessary to keep <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-353">ice</span> crystal sizes small.</p>
        <p>Further temperature reduction during hardening accounts for continued growth of the preformed crystals. As <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water"  id="ic2-354">water</span> freezes out of solution in a relatively pure form, the formation of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-355">ice</span> acts to concentrate the dissolved <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic2-356">sugars</span>, <span class="mention component" about="lactose" id="ic2-357">lactose</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic2-358">milk</span> <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic2-359">proteins</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="salt" id="ic2-360">salts</span>, and <span class="mention component" about="hydrocolloids" id="ic2-361">hydrocolloids</span> in an ever-decreasing amount of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-362">water</span>. <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-363">Water</span> and its dissolved components are referred to as the serum or matrix of the mix. Because the freezing point of the serum is a function of the concentration of dissolved solids, formation of more <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-364">ice</span> concentrates the serum and results in an ever decreasing freezing temperature for the remaining serum. Therefore, at temperatures several degrees below the initial freezing temperature, there is always an unfrozen phase present. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-365">Ice cream</span> hardness is a function of temperature due to its effect on this conversion from unfrozen <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic2-366">water</span> to <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-367">ice</span> and further concentration of the serum phase surrounding the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-368">ice</span> crystals, which helps to give <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-369">ice cream</span> its ability to be scooped and chewed at freezer temperatures.</p>

        <h3>Structure Formation During Manufacture</h3>
        <p>The texture of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-370">ice cream</span> is perhaps one of its most important quality attributes. It is the sensory manifestation of structure. Hence, establishment of optimal <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-371">ice cream</span> structure is critical to maximal textural quality. The structure of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-372">ice cream</span> begins with the mix as a simple emulsion, with a discrete phase of partially crystalline <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-373">fat</span> globules surrounded by an interfacial layer composed of <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic2-374">proteins</span> and surfactants. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-375">Ice cream</span> is a complex food colloid in that the mix emulsion is subsequently foamed, creating a dispersed phase of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-376">air bubbles</span>, and is frozen, forming another dispersed phase of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-377">ice</span> crystals. <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic2-378">Air bubbles</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic2-379">ice</span> crystals are usually in the range of 20–50 &mu;m. The serum phase is freeze-concentrated. In addition, the partially crystalline <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-380">fat</span> phase at refrigerated temperatures undergoes partial coalescence during the concomitant whipping and freezing process, resulting in a network of agglomerated <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic2-381">fat</span>,</p>

        <h3>Packaging of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-383">Ice Cream</span></h3>
        <p>A good package must contain the product, protect it, provide convenience, and provide information on the product to the consumer. Food packages provide protection against physical, chemical, and biological damages. It also provides information useful to the consumer, for example, ingredient label, nutritional label, net contents, serving suggestion, and methods of preparing the product. Besides these attributes, a good food package keeps the food at nearly the same quality as when it was manufactured. During distribution, packages are subjected to physical abuses such as shocks, vibrations, compression, and, in the case of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-384">ice cream</span> and <span class="mention food" about="frozenDessert" id="ic2-385">frozen desserts</span>, heat shock.</p>
        <p>For <span class="mention food" about="frozenDessert" id="ic2-386">frozen dessert</span> packaging, three main factors have to be considered. First, the package has to protect the product against temperature fluctuations, photooxidation, dehydration, and odor transmittance.

        <h3>Storage and Distribution</h3>
        <p>Frozen and hardened product is stored and often distributed prior to the enjoyment by the end consumer. The intermediate steps involved in storage vary depending upon the scale of manufacture, market share, point of sale, and consumer preferences. In the simplest case of a retail <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-387">ice cream</span> manufacturer, the product is made fresh in the store and sold very soon after manufacture, and this requires relatively few controls. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-388">Ice cream</span> is unique in that it is the only product that is consumed in the frozen state. Therefore, once it is manufactured, it has to be stored, transported, distributed, and sold in the frozen state. In the <span class="mention place" about="USA" id="ic2-521" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span>, frozen foods are distributed in a separate chain than <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-389">ice cream</span> is because the cold chain for frozen foods is -18 &deg;C (0 &deg;F) and is inadequate for <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-390">ice cream</span>. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-391">Ice cream</span> cold chain maintains -23 &deg;C (-10 &deg;F). The distribution chain is called the cold chain and varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. Regardless of variations, the cold chain is imperfect. This imperfection affects the quality of the product at the point of purchase and impacts consumer satisfaction. Factors affecting the shelf life of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic2-392">ice cream</span> are manufacturing procedures, warehouse equipment, warehouse handling practices, transportation, storage at retail premises, retail display equipment, and retail handling practices.</p>
