                      <p><span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-53">Brown</span> began paying attention to this planetary overdraft during the late two&#8211;thousands, even as his lab was publishing on topics ranging from <span class="mention disease" about="ovarianCancer" id="1b-54">ovarian&#8211;cancer detection</span> to how babies acquire their gut microbiome.

                      <p>For another thing, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-246">meat</span> is wildly inefficient. Because <span class="mention animals" about="livestock" id="1b-247">cattle </span> use their feed not only to grow muscle but also to grow bones and a tail and to trot around and to think their mysterious thoughts, their energy&#8211;conversion efficiency&#8212;	the number of calories their meat contains compared with the number they take in to make it&#8212;	is a woeful one per cent.</p>
                      <p>It&#8217;s easy enough to replicate some animal products (<span class="mention food" about="eggWhites" id="1b-248">egg whites</span> are basically just nine <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-249">proteins</span> and <span class="mention components" about="water" id="1b-250">water</span>), but mimicking cooked
                         <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-251">ground beef</span> is a real undertaking. Broadly speaking, a <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="1b-252">burger</span> is <span class="mention components" about="water" id="1b-253">sixty per cent water</span>,
                         <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-254">twenty&#8211;five per cent protein</span>, and <span class="mention components" about="fat" id="1b-255">fifteen per cent fat</span>, but, broadly speaking, if you assembled forty&#8211;two litres of water you&#8217;d be sixty per cent of the way to a human being. Cooked <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-256">beef</span> contains at least four thousand different molecules, of which about a hundred contribute to its aroma and flavor and two dozen contribute to its appearance and texture. When you heat plant parts, they get softer, or they wilt. When you heat a
                         <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="1b-257">burger</span>, its <span class="mention components" about="aminoacids" id="1b-258">amino acids</span> react with simple <span class="mention components" about="sugars" id="1b-259">sugars</span> and
                         <span class="mention components" about="fat" id="1b-260">unsaturated fats</span> to form flavor compounds. The <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-261">proteins</span> also change shape to form <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-262">protein gels</span> and
                         <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-263">insoluble protein aggregates</span>&#8212;	chewy bits&#8212;	as the patty browns and its juices caramelize. This transformation gives cooked <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-264">meat</span> its nuanced complexity: its yummy umami.</p>
                      <p>Mimicking these qualities was the task <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-265">Pat Brown</span> undertook in 2011, when he decided, after organizing a workshop on animal agriculture that accomplished nothing, that he&#8217;d have to solve the problem himself. He worked up a pitch, then bicycled down the road from <span class="mention place" about="Stanford" id="1b-266">Stanford</span> to three venture&#8211;capital firms. His pitch had everything V.C.s like to fund: a huge market, a novel way to attack it, and a passionate founder who already talked the talk. <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-267">Brown</span>&#8217;s habit of referring to &#8220;the technology that provides us with

Then
                        <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-274">Brown</span> started hiring scientists, most of whom had no food expertise. His wife, <span class="mention person" about="SueKlapholz" id="1b-275">Sue Klapholz</span>, who trained as a psychiatrist and worked as a geneticist, became the company&#8217;s nutritionist. &#8220;I had been making jewelry and doing nature photography, having this great retirement,&#8221; she told me, still surprised by this turn in their lives.

                      <p>For alternative&#8211;protein companies, the first challenge is often producing a <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-279">protein</span> that&#8217;s utterly tasteless. A flavor packet can then make it delicious. A startup called <span class="mention company" about="Spira" id="1b-280">Spira</span>, for instance, is attempting to develop <span class="mention food ingredients" about="spirulina" id="1b-281">algae called spirulina</span> as a food source. &#8220;The problem is that it&#8217;s a slimy goop,&#8221;

So the company&#8217;s scientists had to learn how to erase those flavors, even as they were learning the subtleties of the aroma and taste they were trying to emulate.</p>
                      <p>One morning in <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-291" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible</span>&#8217;s lab, <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-292">Brown</span> showed me a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer, which is used to identify the molecules that appear in <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-293">meat</span>
                         as it&#8217;s cooked and to link those molecules to odors. &#8220;Some poor schmuck has their nose stuck in here for forty&#8211;five minutes,&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-294">Brown</span> said, indicating a plastic nose mold that protruded from the machine. &#8220;You have to bunny&#8211;sniff at a very high rate, often trying to characterize molecules you&#8217;ve never smelled before.&#8221; He looked at a handwritten list from the last assay: &#8220;You might say, 	&#8216;We&#8217;ve got to get rid of &#8220;Band&#8211;Aid,&#8221; or &#8220;skunk,&#8221; or &#8220;diaper pail&#8221;

                      <p>Most  <span class="mention food" about="plantbasedBurger" id="1b-296">veggie burgers</span> are formed by an extruder, a machine that operates like a big pressure cooker, using heat and compression to replicate <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-297">meat</span>&#8217;s fibrous morphology. <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-298">Brown</span> suspected that the key to a truly meaty
                        <span class="mention food" about="plantbasedBurger" id="1b-299">plant burger</span> was an ingredient.

                      <p><span class="mention person" about="TimSearchinger" id="1b-ii8">Searchinger</span> had brought a list of detailed questions about the company&#8217;s costs and its supply chain, which the execs met with assured generalities. <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii9">Brown</span> said, &#8220;Another advantage we have over the incumbent technology is that we keep improving our product every week.

                      <p><span class="mention person" about="TimSearchinger" id="1b-ii18">Searchinger</span> studied his list and said, &#8220;One thing that will be critical is acceptance in the developing world&#8212;	finding local agricultural associations that make precursor products for you, before the local <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii19">beef</span> guys put you out of business.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>&#8220;I completely agree,&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii20">Brown</span> said. North <span class="mention place" about="America" id="1b-ii21" data-wikidata-id:"Q30" data-label="United States of America">America</span> makes up only twelve per cent of the global market for <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-ii22">meat</span>; he needed to wipe out

                      <p><span class="mention person" about="TimSearchinger" id="1b-ii24">Searchinger</span> said, &#8220;Our baseline estimate is that by 2050, to produce the <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii25">beef</span> to meet demand, we&#8217;ll see a hundred and fifty&#8211;eight million hectares more pastureland in <span class="mention place" about="Africa" id="1b-ii26" data-wikidata-id:"Q15" data-label="Africa">Africa

                      <p><span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii28">Brown</span> made a face. &#8220;To head that off, we have to be seen as successful in the U.S. and developed countries first,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we&#8217;re seen as a cheap substitute, we won&#8217;t get any traction in <span class="mention place" about="Africa" id="1b-ii29" data-wikidata-id:"Q15" data-label="Africa">Africa</span>.&#8221;</p>
                      <p><span class="mention person" about="TimSearchinger" id="1b-ii30">Searchinger</span> looked wistful. &#8220;If you could just <span class="mention ClimateChange" about="reforestation" id="1b-ii31">reforest all the grazing land</span>, 1.2 billion hectares!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Giving up all <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii32">beef</span> would be the most effective thing we could do for the planet.&#8221; He has calculated that if you reduced
                        <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii33">beef</span> consumption by three&#8211;fourths (allowing for some pastoral nomadism and <span class="mention animals" class="cows" id="1b-ii34">dairy cows</span> later used for <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii35">beef</span>) and reforested accordingly it would reduce global
                        <span class="mention ClimateChange" about="GHGemissions" id="1b-ii36">G.H.G. emissions</span> by about twenty per cent.</p>
                      <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take care of getting rid of all <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii37">beef</span> for you,&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii38">Brown</span> said. They smiled and shook hands.</p>
                      <p><span class="mention person" about="TimSearchinger" id="1b-ii39">Searchinger</span> later told me, &#8220;Innovation from places like <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii40" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible</span> is the one thing that allows me to have a tiny bit of optimism.&#8221; But he still believed too many complicating, countervailing things. A week after his visit, he co&#8211;wrote an op&#8211;ed for

                      <p>In June, more than a thousand people descended on the <span class="mention company" about="QulityHotelGlobe" id="1b-ii45">Quality Hotel Globe</span>, in <span class="mention place" about="Stockholm" id="1b-ii46" data-wikidata-id:"Q1754" data-label="Stockholm">Stockholm</span>, to discuss how to feed the world without destroying it. The annual conference of <span class="mention company" about="EAT" id="1b-ii47">EAT</span>, a Scandinavian nonprofit dedicated to making our food system sustainable, showcased backpacks and business beards, talk of the Global South and the Global North, and the AirDropping of dire bar graphs. There was an atmosphere of acerbic self&#8211;satisfaction, a sense that only those present understood both what it would take to save humanity and that it was probably too late. At dinner, after the chef

                        I&#8217;d say conferences like this are an excuse for these guys to bop around the world meeting each other.&#8221;
                      </p>
                      <p>Yet when <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii51">Brown</span> was interviewed on the main stage, wearing the outfit his comms team had specified&#8212;	&#8220;NO COW T&#8211;shirt, blazer and jeans&#8221;&#8212;	he was upbeat. He&#8217;s become a more confident, less academic public speaker of late, having mostly learned not to point with his middle finger or end refutations with &#8220;Q.E.D.&#8221; He now distilled his message to a congenial set of propositions:
                      <i>Lecturing people doesn&#8217;t work. This is a technology problem. And we&#8217;ve solved it.</i> He left his provocative &#8220;I ♥ GMO&#8221; water bottle in his backpack.</p>
                      <p>Offstage, however, he couldn&#8217;t resist disputation. Watching a panel discussion in which a British <span class="mention animals" about="livestock" id="1b-ii52">cattle</span> rancher lauded &#8220;<span class="mention ClimateChange" about="grazing" id="1b-ii53">regenerative grazing,&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii54">Brown</span> stuck out his tongue and murmured, &#8220;I am so tempted to shout out,
                        &#8216;This is bullshit!&#8217; &#8221; The rancher&#8217;s ideas were premised on the increasingly popular practice of &#8220;grass&#8211;feeding&#8221;
                        <span class="mention animals" about="livestock" id="1b-ii55">cattle</span>, and further shaped by the theories of the Zimbabwean rancher
                        <span class="mention person" about="AllanSavory" id="1b-ii56">Allan Savory</span>, who believes that herds of <span class="mention animals" about="livestock" id="1b-ii57">livestock</span> that are ushered to a new pasture as soon as they&#8217;ve cropped the grass can reverse <span class="mention ClimateChange" about="desertification" id="1b-ii58">desertification</span> and make grasslands a carbon sink. To

                      <p>&#8220;I have yet to see scientific evidence that <span class="mention animals food" about="goat" id="1b-ii85">goats</span> and <span class="mention animals food" about="chicken" id="1b-ii86">chickens</span> have pushed out other species,&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="LindiweMajeleSibanda" id="1b-ii87"> Sibanda</span> said. &#8220;Remember, you&#8217;re looking at arid and semiarid areas, so when you say,

The technique proved hugely useful in distinguishing normal tissue from cancerous tissue and identifying a given <span class="mention disease" about="cancer" id="1b-ii150">cancer</span>; it established, for instance, that there isn&#8217;t one kind of <span class="mention disease" about="breastCancer" id="1b-ii151">breast cancer</span> but six.

He loves the office&#8212;	&#8220;It gives me a burst of happiness when I come in&#8221;&#8212;	but hates having to compartmentalize information and to suppress his instinct for combat.
                        &#8220;My favorite thing to do is to get into an argument, but my superego can&#8217;t snooze through the day the way it used to,&#8221; he told me. Still, he can&#8217;t resist interrogating norms that strike him as defective. At a recent meeting to consider promotions for ten staffers, <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii155">Brown</span> derailed the agenda by questioning the whole idea of tiered titles.
                        After half an hour, <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii156" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible</span>&#8217;s new president, <span class="mention person" about="DennisWoodside" id="1b-ii157">Dennis Woodside</span>, the former C.O.O. of <span class="mention company" about="Dropbox" id="1b-ii158">Dropbox</span>, said, in gentle disbelief, &#8220;Last week, we were very close to promoting eight or nine
                      people, and now we&#8217;re going to take everyone&#8217;s titles away?&#8221; Unruffled, <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii159">Brown</span> said, &#8220;Is there a way to have a more sensible system that wasn&#8217;t invented for I.B.M.?&#8221;</p>
                      <p>Brown&#8217;s brother <span class="mention person" about="RichardBrown" id="1b-ii160">Richard</span> said, &#8220;<span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii161">Pat</span> optimistically holds to the belief that people are rational and can be convinced by evidence. Some of the frustration he feels is that food is different&#8212;	there&#8217;s so much subjectivity to it.&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii162">Brown</span> remains mystified, for instance, by Americans&#8217; eagerness to add
                        <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-ii163">protein</span> to their diets when they already consume far more than is necessary. Nonetheless, he beefed up the protein in his burgers. &#8220;There are things we do that are effectively just acknowledging widespread erroneous beliefs about nutrition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For the same reasons, we initially used only <span class="mention food ClimateChange" about="nonGMOcrops" id="1b-ii164">non&#8211;G.M.O. crops</span>, which was essentially pandering. We&#8217;re not trying to win arguments but to achieve the mission.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>He is equally baffled by challenges from people who agree with his goals but question his methods. In 2017, the environmentalist organizations <span class="mention company" about="ETCgroup" id="1b-ii165">ETC Group</span> and <span class="mention company" about="FriendsoftheEarth" id="1b-ii166">Friends of the Earth</span> attacked <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii167" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible</span>, claiming that
                        <span class="mention components" about="heme" id="1b-ii168">heme</span> was potentially unsafe and that its patty &#8220;implicates the extreme genetic engineering field of synthetic biology, particularly the new high&#8211;tech investor trend of 	&#8216;vat itarian&#8217; foods.&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii169">Brown</span> published a comprehensive response, in which he pointed out that &#8220;your own bloodstream right now contains about as much

                        <span class="mention company" about="PeoplefortheEthicalTreatmentofAnimals" id="1b-ii178">peta</span> spitefully added that &#8220;the

But if you&#8217;re a <i>heretic</i>&#8212;
                        that&#8217;s a capital crime.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>The spread of <span class="mention animals" about="livestock" id="1b-ii182">livestock</span> is largely responsible for the ultimate in the unethical treatment of animals; since 1970, the world&#8217;s wild animal populations have diminished by an average of sixty per cent. But <span class="mention company" about="PeoplefortheEthicalTreatmentofAnimals" id="1b-ii183">peta</span>, in its zeal, often fails to grapple with the nuances of means and ends. For instance, it opposes eating
                        <span class="mention animals food ingredients" about="chicken" id="1b-ii184">chicken</span>, pointing to the abuses of factory farming. American <span class="mention animals food ingredients" about="chicken" id="1b-ii185">broilers, chickens</span> raised for <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-ii186">meat</span>, are bred and confined in ways that make them more than four times larger than broilers were in the nineteen sixties; as a result, they often collapse from their own weight. <span class="mention person" about="JacyReese" id="1b-ii187">Jacy Reese
                        </span>, in &#8220;The End of Animal Farming,&#8221; noted that &#8220;consuming smaller animals leads to far more suffering per calorie because it takes far more animals.&#8221; By comparing the number of days that various kinds of <span class="mention animals" about="livestock" id="1b-ii188">livestock</span> spend in factory&#8211;farm conditions, <span class="mention person" about="JacyReese" id="1b-ii189">Reese</span> determined that eating <span class="mention animals food ingredients" about="chicken" id="1b-ii190">chicken</span> is nineteen times worse than eating
                        <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii191">beef</span>. But it&#8217;s vastly better for the <span class="mention ClimateChange" about="environment" id="1b-ii192">environment</span>&#8212;	poultry production has about one&#8211;eighth the <span class="mention ClimateChange" about="climateImpact" id="1b-ii193">climate impact</span> of

                      <p>Believing you&#8217;re right doesn&#8217;t salve the bruises from these ethical struggles. <span class="mention person" about="SueKlapholz" id="1b-ii195">Sue Klapholz</span> told me, &#8220;Our mission was too important not to do the animal testing, but <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii196">Pat</span> and I would never want to do it again. Our youngest son had a <span class="mention animals" about="rats" id="1b-ii197">pet rat</span>, and they&#8217;re very smart animals that like to have toys.

                      <p>While the lobbyists at the <span class="mention company" about="BeefAssociation" id="1b-ii324">N.C.B.A.</span> acknowledged that <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii325">beef</span> has some environmental liabilities, they said that those concerns would soon be mitigated by the same American ingenuity that has &#8220;productized&#8221; every inch of the <span class="mention animals food ingredients" about="cow" id="1b-ii326">cow</span>.

                      <p>I observed that, despite all these efficiencies, the magazine Science had recently identified giving up <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-ii332">meat</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="dairy" id="1b-ii333">dairy</span> as the most powerful <span class="mention ClimateChange" about="enviroment" id="1b-ii334">nvironmental act</span> any individual could make. &#8220;There are more reports like that than we care to see,&#8221;

More significantly, the <span class="mention company" about="EnvironmentalProtectionAgency" id="1b-ii350">E.P.A.</span>&#8217;s accounting, like many such assessments, fails to factor in the <span class="mention ClimateChange" about="GHGemissions" id="1b-ii351">G.H.G. impact</span> of animal agriculture&#8217;s land use. According to the World Resources Institute, if Americans replaced a third of the <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii352">beef</span> in their diets with

                      <p>In most of the world, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii355">beef</span> production is vastly less efficient than it is in <span class="mention place" about="America" id="1b-ii356" data-wikidata-id:"Q30" data-label="United States of America">America</span>. <span class="mention person" about="FrankMitloehner" id="1b-ii357">Frank Mitloehner</span>, a professor in the department of animal science at the

                      <p>Richard <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii385">Brown</span>said, &#8220;Early on, we had two goals that were fully aligned: to be identical to a <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="1b-ii386">burger from a cow</span>, and to be much better than a <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="1b-ii387">burger from a cow</span>.

We could choose a <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-ii404">meat</span> flavor better than
                        <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii405">beef</span> or

                        &#8220;But it has to be a side project, for now, because the more sure way to crush the <span class="mention animals food ingredients" about="chicken" id="1b-ii410">chicken</span> producers is to make the best version of <span class="mention animals food ingredients" about="chicken" id="1b-ii411">chicken</span>.&#8221;</p>

                        <span class="mention components" about="fats" id="1b-ii415">fat</span>, and <span class="mention components" about="calcium" id="1b-ii416">calcium</span> content of <span class="mention food ingredients" about="dairyMilk" id="1b-ii417">dairy milk</span>. The only issue was that it tasted like water. &#8220;We have to do more work to give it

                      <p>The flavor scientist <span class="mention person" about="LauraKliman" id="1b-ii420">Laura Kliman</span> made me a <span class="mention food" about="plantBasedPaella" id="1b-ii421">tasty fish paella</span>.

                      <p>Next up was <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii429" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible</span> Steak Flavor&#8212;	a beaker full of red juice. A scientist named <span class="mention person" about="IanRonningen" id="1b-ii430">Ian Ronningen</span> poured it into a saucepan, turned on the gas, and began swirling the juice with a metal spatula. As it reduced and turned brown, he said, &#8220;Now you&#8217;re getting a change of flavor.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>His colleague <span class="mention person" about="AllenHenderson" id="1b-ii431">Allen Henderson</span> softly confided, &#8220;We feel that we have sufficiently recapitulated the multiple chemistries of cooked <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii432">beef</span>.&#8221;</p>
                      <p><span class="mention person" about="IanRonningen" id="1b-ii433">Ronningen</span> bent over the bubbling goo, wafted the steam toward his nose, and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m starting to get that really wonderful <span class="mentio components" about="fats" id="1b-ii434">fat</span> note.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="DavidLipman" id="1b-ii435">Lipman</span> said, doing some wafting. &#8220;There&#8217;s an animalic quality.

                      <p>&#8220;And we get these grizzled pieces, just like a <span class="mention food" about="steak" id="1b-ii437">steak</span>,&#8221; <span class="mention person" about="IanRonningen" id="1b-ii438">Ronningen</span> said. &#8220;If we have a <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-ii439">deflavored protein</span>, which we&#8217;re good at, we can take this flavor and put it on a

It was literally the sizzle, not the <span class="mention food" about="steak" id="1b-ii442">steak</span>&#8212;	but it was delicious.</p>
                      <p><span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii443">Brown</span>told me it was &#8220;time to double down on <span class="mention food" about="steak" id="1b-ii444">steak</span>, for mission reasons.&#8221; He planned to use another chunk of the three hundred million dollars he&#8217;d just raised to accelerate his R. & D., hiring ninety more scientists. Small teams would immediately begin work
                      on <span class="mention food" about="chickenNuggets" id="1b-ii445">chicken nuggets</span> and <span class="mention food" about="cheese" id="1b-ii446">melty cheese for pizza</span>.

                      </span>, and to pursue a general methodology for stripping <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-ii449">plant proteins</span> of their off&#8211;colors and off&#8211;flavors.</p>
                      <p>After years of focus, <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii450">Brown</span>was beginning to return to his preferred mode of swashbuckling inquiry.

                        <span class="mention components" about="proteins" id="1b-ii453">protein</span> in the world, as his staple ingredient.
                        <span class="mention components" about="proteins rubisco" id="1b-ii454">RuBisCo</span> is an <span class="mention components" about="enzyme" id="1b-ii455">enzyme</span> used for photosynthesis that&#8217;s found in the leaves of plants like <span class="mention food ingredients" about="soy" id="1b-ii456">soy</span> and

But no one produces

                        </span> can provide the nutritional equivalent of

                        <span class="mention components" about="heme" id="1b-ii492">heme</span>, proved expensive. The company has increased its yield of the <span class="mention components" about="heme" id="1b-ii493">molecule</span> more than sevenfold in four years, and, <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii494">Brown</span>said, &#8220;we&#8217;re
                        no longer agonizing over the impact of <span class="mention components" about="heme" id="1b-ii495">heme</span> on our cost.&#8221; He now hopes to equal the price of <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii496">ground beef</span> by 2022.</p>
                      <p>P<span class="mention food ingredients" about="plantbasedMeat" id="1b-ii497">Plant&#8211;based meat</span> won&#8217;t become a shopping&#8211;cart staple unless it achieves price parity, and some observers worry about how long that&#8217;s taking. <span class="mention person" about="DaveFriedberg" id="1b-ii498">Dave Friedberg</span>, the founder of the <span class="mention company" about="ProductionBoard" id="1b-ii499"> Production Board</span>, an incubator for
                        alternative&#8211;protein companies, noted the expense of <span class="mention components" about="heme" id="1b-ii500">heme</span> and texturized <span class="mention components" about="proteins soyProteins" id="1b-ii501">soy protein</span>. &#8220;I&#8217;m concerned that we&#8217;re never going to get to the price of <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="1b-ii502">ground beef</span>,&#8221;
                        <span class="mention person" about="DaveFriedberg" id="1b-ii503">Friedberg</span> told me.
                        &#8220;And to sell people a product that&#8217;s not <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-ii504">meat</span>, and charge more for it, won&#8217;t shift the world to a new agricultural system.&#8221;</p>
                      <p>Shifting the world to a new agricultural system is not part of a fast&#8211;food chain&#8217;s business model. So the chains question whether <span class="mention diets" about="plantBased" id="1b-ii505">plant&#8211;based</span> will prove to be a trend, like <span class="mention cuisinetype" about="spicyFood" id="1b-ii506">spicy food</span>, or merely a fad, like <span class="mention food" about="ricebowls" id="1b-ii507">rice bowls</span>.

                      <p>Right now, they do. In July, <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii515" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible</span> announced that, after tripling production at its <span class="mention place" about="Oakland" id="1b-ii516" data-wikidata-id:"Q17042" data-label="Oakland">Oakland</span> factory and signing a deal to make its <span class="mention food" about="plantbasedBurger" id="1b-ii517">burgers at plants
                      </span> belonging to a
                        <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-ii518">meat</span>&#8211;processing behemoth called the OSI Group, it was no longer restricting deliveries to any of its distributors. The company planned to increase production fourfold by the end of the year. It was once more blasting ahead.</p>
                      <p>Yet, the greater its progress, the wider the gap between what <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii519">Brown</span>hopes to do and what his investors expect to gain&#8212;	between idealism and market value. <span class="mention person" about="VinodKhosla" id="1b-ii520">Vinod Khosla</span>, at <span class="mention company" about="KhoslaVentures" id="1b-ii521">Khosla Ventures</span>, has assured

                      fifty&#8211;six. <span class="mention person" about="BrianLoeb" id="1b-ii529">Brian Loeb</span>, an investor at <span class="mention company" about="ContinentalGrain" id="1b-ii530">Continental Grain</span>, a large agricultural&#8211;products holding company that invested in <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii531" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible</span> in 2016, said,
                      &#8220;The industry&#8211;wide conversation now is around &#8216;Can <span class="mention food ingredients" about="plantbasedMeat" id="1b-ii532">plant&#8211;based meats</span> get to five per cent of the market?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
                      <p>During my last visit to <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii533" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible Foods</span>, <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii534">Brown</span>admitted that he was somewhat at the mercy of his investors. &#8220;I was more naïve than I wish I&#8217;d been early on in terms of how my control gets affected by repeated rounds of funding,&#8221; he said, as we sat in Yam, a small conference room near his desk. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the hard power to say no, if someone wants to buy us. I have a reasonable amount of soft power, to the extent that I can convince our investors that they&#8217;d be missing out on continued growth if they sold. The best defense we have is doing well&#8212;	and if we&#8217;re not doing well then who cares if we get sold to
                        <span class="mention company" about="TysonFoods" id="1b-ii535">Tyson Foods</span>?&#8221;</p>
                      <p>&#8220;Do you, deep down, believe that nobody else is approaching the problem correctly?&#8221; I asked.</p>
                      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about how it sounds, but yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nobody else has caught on to the fact that this is the most important scientific problem in the world, so their results are just a reheated version of
                        <span class="mention food" about="plantbasedBurger" id="1b-ii536">veggie burgers</span> from ten years ago, maybe with a little lipstick on them. And cell&#8211;based companies are just taking the same technology <span class="mention animals food ingredients" class="cows" id="1b-ii537">cows</span> have used to grow <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1b-ii538">meat</span> for a thousand years and making it less efficient.&#8221; His impatience was plain. It struck me that while, as a scientist,
                        <span class="mention person" about="PatBrown" id="1b-ii539">Brown</span>welcomes searching questions and alternative ideas, as a missionary he believes that searching questions and alternative ideas waste time&#8212;	time we simply don&#8217;t have.</p>
                      <p>I wondered whether it had occurred to him that he had essentially devised a tortuous work&#8211;around for human selfishness. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;I do find that interesting. Strategically, a <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="1b-ii540">hamburger</span> is hugely symbolic. But it&#8217;s also completely trite and ridiculous. If you&#8217;d told me ten years ago that I&#8217;d be totally focussed on <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="1b-ii541">burgers</span>, I&#8217;d have thought, <i>Well, that&#8217;s not a life I want.&#8221;
                      </i>
                      </p>
                      <p>After a moment, he returned to the question of whether he had any true partners. &#8220;I&#8217;m aware of our investors&#8217; feelings, and to some extent disappointed by them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People aren&#8217;t used to doubling in size and impact every year&#8212;	that&#8217;s a very steep and unrelenting curve, and even venture investors are incredibly conservative. They realize that something far short of our goal is a massive investment success for them. If they were completely confident, they would be backing trucks up to <span class="mention company" about="ImpossibleFoods" id="1b-ii542" data-wikidata-id:"Q21515382" data-label="Impossible Foods">Impossible Foods</span> loaded with billion&#8211;dollar bills.&#8221; He grinned, and went on, &#8220;But they&#8217;re wrong! Kodak and the horse&#8211;and&#8211;buggy industry thought
                        they&#8217;d just coexist with the new technology, too. I only picked 2035 because it seemed like something you could plausibly achieve, something that other people could at least see a path to. I would have picked sooner.&#8221; ♦</p>

                  <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-41">burger</span> a week, up from 38 percent two years ago. Additional findings show that consumers—particularly young consumers—want more options in their <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-42">hamburger</span> choices, including
                  <span class="mention diets" about="vegetarianism" id="2b-43">vegetarian</span> choices, and they are willing to pay more for these premiums. The top chart on page 73 illustrates Americans’ differential willingness to pay more for certain options. For instance, what <span class="mention animals ingredients" about="cows" id="2b-44">cows</span> eat, how they are raised, and where they come from are important concerns for consumers today.<p>

                  <p>These desires have come about through changes in consumer behaviors as a direct result of food-based social movements. In their 2008 Adminstrative Science Quarterly article entitled <span class="mention report" about="ForageforThought" id="2b-45">“Forage for Thought: Mobilizing Codes in the Movement for Grass-fed Meat and Dairy Products,”</span> authors <span class="mention person" about="KlausWeber" id="2b-46">Klaus Weber</span>, <span class="mention person" about="KathyrnHeinze" id="2b-47">Kathyrn Heinze</span> and
                  <span class="mention person" about="MichaelaDeSoucey" id="2b-48">Michaela DeSoucey</span> show that social movements create cultural codes around the <span class="mention company" about="beefindustry" id="2b-49">beef industry</span> that require producers to adjust their production standards, as well as provide consumers with ways to make ethical decisions in the marketplace. Through these demands, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="2b-50"> grass-fed beef</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="2b-51">hormone-free beef
                  </span>, and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="2b-52">steroid-free beef </span>have become staples in the world of <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-53">hamburgers</span>.</p>

                  <p>The surge in <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-54">hamburger</span> consumption has been driven by the increased number of better <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-55">burger</span> chains, and the growing availability of

Based on a 2011 report from <span class="mention company" about="Technomic" id="2b-148">Technomic
                  </span>, the other chart on this page shows the top 10 fastest growing better
                  <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-58">burger</span> chains. The rise of these better <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-59">burger</span> chains is a direct response to consumer demand for more ethical and environmentally friendly <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-60">hamburgers</span>.</p>

                  <p>The <span class="mention cuisinetype" about="gourmet" id="2b-61">gourmet</span> <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-62">hamburger</span>, on the other hand, exemplifies an important concept in the sociology of culture, and more specifically food: the notion of <span class="mention diets" about="omnivore" id="2b-63">omnivorousness</span>. Sociologists have described
                  <span class="mention diets" about="omnivorousness" id="2b-64">omnivorousness</span> as a type of cultural consumption that allows high-status groups to show off their distinction from other groups through their knowledge of a range of cultural forms, from low culture to high culture. These insights into the sociology of culture have been developed in part from
                  <span class="mention person" about="PierreBourdie" id="2b-65" data-wikidata-id:"Q156268" data-label="Pierre Bourdie">Pierre Bourdieu</span>’s seminal work Distinction, which showed how aesthetic preferences and cultural tastes were directly related to social class. <span class="mention person" about="PierreBourdie" id="2b-66" data-wikidata-id:"Q156268" data-label="Pierre Bourdie">Bourdieu</span> also found that certain cultural preferences were equated with “good taste” and those in privileged class postions often had access to these preferences, while those with less status and wealth did not. As food is a major element of culture in society, the
                  <span class="mention food" about="burger" id="2b-67">hamburger</span> has become an important container for expressing these preferences in contemporary American cuisine.

                  <p>In their book Foodies: Democracy and Distinction in the Gourmet Foodscape, sociologists <span class="mention person" about="JoséeJohnston" id="2b-70">Josée Johnston</span> and <span class="mention person" about="ShyonBaumann" id="2b-71">Shyon Baumann</span> examine <span class="mention diets" about="omnivore" id="2b-72">omnivorousness</span> in American <span class="mention cuisinetype" about="gourmet" id="2b-73">gourmet</span> food culture. They find that
                  <span class="mention diets" about="omnivore" id="2b-74">omnivorousness</span> operates based on a shared notion of what is legitimate or illegitimate as a <span class="mention cuisinetype" about="gourmet" id="2b-75">gourmet</span> food item. Food legitimacy is based on two criteria: authenticity and exoticism. Authenticity refers to the simplicity of the dish, the geographic region it comes from, the personal connection to the consumer, ethnic connections, history and tradition. Exoticism refers to geographically distant, norm-breaking, and unusual elements of an item. Through the use of these critiria, “foodies” employ a range of cultural knowledge about the products they are consuming as a sign of status in their peer groups and throughout society. <span class="mention person" about="JoséeJohnston" id="2b-76">Johnston</span> and <span class="mention person" about="ShyonBaumann" id="2b-77">Baumann</span> provide a two-by-two figure (see chart on page 74) relating authenticity and exoticism in relation to certain types of foodstuffs.
