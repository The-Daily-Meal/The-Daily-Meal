          <p>
            <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-1">Pasta</span> is an ancient food widely consumed in the world and
            represents one of the staple foods of the Mediterranean diet.
            There are many theories concerning its origin. Some researchers
            place its origin in the thirteenth century by <span class="mention person" about="MarcoPolo" id="1p-2" data-wikidata-id="Q6101">Marco Polo</span>, who
            introduced <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-3">pasta</span> in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-414" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> upon returning from one of his trips to
            <span class="mention place" about="China" id="1p-4" data-wikidata-id="Q29520">China</span> in 1271. However, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-5">pasta</span> dates much further back, maybe
            to the ancient Etruscans, who made <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-6">pasta</span> by grinding several
            <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-7">cereals</span> and grains and then mixing them with <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-9">water</span>, a blend
            that was later on cooked producing a tasty and nutritious food.
            The term ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="macaroni" id="1p-10">macaroni</span>,’ which is currently referred to as a long type
            of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-11">pasta</span>, is found in the documents of Roman writers since the
            first centuries ‘after Christ.’ However, both the Etruscans and the
            Romans baked their <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="noodles" id="1p-12">noodles</span> in an oven, so boiled <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-13">pasta</span> had yet
            to be born in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-14" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span>. As the centuries went by, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-15">pasta</span> continued to
            appear on the tables of <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-415" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> with different names. For example,
            in 1400, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-16">pasta</span> was called ‘lasagna’ and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-17">pasta</span> manufacturers were
            referred to as ‘lasagnare,’ while in 1800, their name turned into
            ‘vermicellai.’ Between 1400 and 1800, a new kind of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-18">pasta</span>, that
            is, ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="fidelli" id="1p-19">fidelli</span>,’ started being manufactured besides ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="lasagne" id="1p-20">lasagne</span>’ and
            ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="vermicelli" id="1p-21">vermicelli</span>.’ ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="fidelli" id="1p-489">Fidelli</span>’ were <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-22">pasta</span> threads with a cylindrical shape,
            and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-23">pasta</span> manufacturers became known as ‘fidellai.’
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the American historian <span class="mention person" about="CharlesPerry" id="1p-24" data-wikidata-id="Q57205426">Charles Perry</span>, who has
            written several articles on the origins of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-25">pasta</span>, the first clear
            western reference to boiled <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="noodles" id="1p-26">noodles</span> is in the Jerusalem Talmud
            of the fifth century AD written in Aramaic for which the term
            ‘itriyah’ was used. By the tenth century, ‘itriyah’ in many Arabic
            sources referred to dried <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="noodles" id="1p-490">noodles</span> bought from a vendor, as
            opposed to fresh ones made at home.

            <p>
              <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-28">Pasta</span> is mainly produced with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-29">wheat flour</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-30">water</span>:
              <span class="mention food ingredients" about="eggs" id="1p-31">eggs</span>
              and/or other optional ingredients can also be added. <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-32">Pasta</span> manufacturers typically use <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-33">milled durum wheat (semolina)</span>
              although <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="SoftWheatFlour" id="1p-34">soft wheat flour</span> and other <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-35">cereal flours</span> are also
              used. <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-36">pasta</span> traditionally consumed in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-37" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> is made exclusively
              with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-38">durum wheat flour</span>, while in other countries, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-39">pasta</span> made
              from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="SoftWheatFlour" id="1p-40">soft wheat</span> and/or other <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-41">cereal flours</span> are also frequently
              consumed. <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-42">Durum wheat</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-43">pasta</span> is made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-602">durum wheat
              semolina</span> (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> L. <i>var. durum</i>) to which <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-603">water</span> is
              added, the reactant, that allows modification of <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins gluten" id="1p-44">gluten</span> via the
              input of mechanical and thermal energy to produce <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-45">pasta</span>.
              Wheat <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-416">proteins</span> help with strengthening <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-46">pasta</span> structure by
              means of entangled aggregation. <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-479">Starch</span>, the major component
              of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-47">semolina</span> and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-48">pasta</span>, occurs in the form of granules dispersed
              within the <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-49">protein</span> network.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-50">Pasta</span> processing consists of three main operations: (1)
              hydrating and mixing–kneading of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-51">semolina</span> to make a
              dough (formation of <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins gluten" id="1p-52">gluten</span> network), (2) shaping the dough
              through extrusion, and (3) stabilizing the shaped <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-53">pasta</span> pieces,
              usually by drying. This sequence of operations is developed in
              an industrial automated scale. The process of hydrating and
              mixing–kneading of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-54">semolina</span> produces a homogeneous
              hydrated dough that is essential for producing high-quality
              <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-55">pasta</span>. To obtain the most homogeneous hydrated mass, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-56">semolina</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-57">water</span> first undergo high-speed premixing (using a
              single or double shaft, vertical or horizontal) to ensure intimate contact between <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-58">semolina</span> particles and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-59">water</span> droplets.
              Further mixing then takes place in the main mixing unit,
              generally under vacuum, that removes air bubbles before the
              mass passes in the extrusion section.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the dough is mixed, it is transferred to the extruder in
              order to obtain a specific form (<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-60">spaghetti</span>, <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="macaroni" id="1p-61">macaroni</span>, etc.) with
              the development of a continuous network of <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins gluten" id="1p-62">gluten</span>  <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-417">protein</span>that
              surrounds the <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-480">starch</span> granules. This process facilitates maintenance of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-63">pasta</span> structure during cooking. The extrusion auger
              forces the dough through the die under high pressure, followed
              by cutting. The die holes are designed to give <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-64">pasta</span> the desired
              shape and size. Compression and extrusion are obtained with
              different machines. Until recently, most dies were made of
              bronze, which was relatively soft and required repair or periodic
              replacement. Recently, dies have been improved by fitting the
              extruding surface of the die with Teflon&#174; inserts to extend the
              life of the dies and improve <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-65">pasta</span> quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drying is the most difficult and critical step to control in the
              <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-66">pasta</span> production process. Drying consists of passing a flow of
              hot or warm air over the fresh <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-67">pasta</span> product, so that the
              thermohygrometric properties of the air progressively decrease
              the <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-68">pasta</span> moisture content at a level acceptable for dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-69">pasta</span>.
              Nowadays, the majority of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-70">pasta</span>-drying processes adopt air
              temperatures in the range of about 70–100 &#176;C while keeping
              product temperatures between 60 and 90 &#176;C. The objective of
              drying is to lower the moisture content of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-71">pasta</span> from &#8764;31&#37; to
              12–13&#37;, so that the finished product is hard, retains its shape,
              and can be stored without spoiling. Dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-72">pasta</span> stored at room
              temperature is stable for years at room temperature.

              make <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-84">pasta</span>, which can be made also from more than one type
              of grain, and, in such a case, it is called ‘multigrain.’

              <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-85">Pasta</span> can be enriched, supplemented, or fortified or remain
              conventional. In recent years, several ingredients have been
              developed and are being used to improve the nutritional quality of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-86">pasta</span>, for example, <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-87">fibers</span>, <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-88">proteins</span>, and

            <p>
              On the basis of scientific evidence showing beneficial effects
              on health of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-449">whole grain</span> product consumption, production of
              <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-442">whole wheat</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-90">pasta</span> is increasing in recent years and many efforts
              have been made to improve its rheological and organoleptic
              properties and to implement its consumption even if this
              product is not yet widely consumed. <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-443">Whole wheat</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-91">pasta</span> is significantly higher in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-92">fiber</span> and nutrients than its refined counterpart: during the refining process, wheat loses roughly 60&#37; of
              its grain, a portion that includes its most nutritious components,
              the bran and the germ. Consequently, refined wheat provides
              less than half the amount of <span class="mention components vitamins" about="vitamins B" id="1p-600">B vitamins</span>, <span class="mention components minerals" about="minerals" id="1p-93">minerals</span>, and <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-94">fibers</span>
              than <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-446">whole grains</span>. At present, there are no food labeling regulations setting the minimum <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-450">whole grain</span> content required for a
              given food to be considered <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-451">whole grain</span>.
              The <span class="mention organization" about="WholeGrainsCouncil" id="1p-95">Whole Grains Council</span> recommends manufacturers to label as ‘<span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-452">whole grain</span>’
              only products containing a higher percentage of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-453">whole grain</span>
              than refined grain (i.e., at least 51&#37; <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-454">whole grain</span>). The
              HEALTHGRAIN Forum proposes two labeling categories, one
              for <span class="mention food" about="bread" id="1p-418">bread</span> and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-96">pasta</span> indicating 100&#37; <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-455">whole grain</span> if the content

              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-238">Starch</span> is the most abundant nutrient in <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="239">pasta</span> and the source
              of rapidly released <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="240">glucose</span> during digestion, regardless of the
              type of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-241">cereal</span> used. The <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-242">starch</span> of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-243">pasta</span> contains two major
              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-244">glucose polymers</span>, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-245">amylose</span> and <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-246">amylopectin</span>, which differ in
              the degree of polymerization (DP) of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-247">glucose</span> chains and in
              the frequency of branches. In particular, wheat endosperm contains &#8764;75–80&#37; of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-248">starch</span> as <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-249">amylopectin</span> and 20–25&#37; as <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-250">amylose</span>.
              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-251">Amylose</span> is a predominantly linear molecule with <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-252">glucose</span>
              chains linked through alpha-1,4 linkages in the range of
              1000–2000 DP, while <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-256">amylopectin</span> is a complex and highly
              branched molecule in the range of 50000–500 000 DP. In <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-257">amylopectin</span>, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-258">glucose</span> units are linked in a linear way with alpha-1,4 linkages. Branching takes place with alpha-1,6 bonds occurring
              every 24–30 <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-259">glucose</span> units, resulting in a soluble molecule that
              can be quickly degraded since it has many end points for
              <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-260">enzymes</span> to attach onto. In contrast, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-261">amylose</span> contains very few
              alpha-1,6 bonds or even none at all. This causes it to be hydrolyzed more slowly but to have a higher density and to be
              insoluble. In raw products, native <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-262">starch</span> occurs naturally as
              insoluble semicrystalline granules assembled in some way to
              form an ordered granular architecture and is not digested by
              human bowel <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-263">enzymes</span>. When it is heated in excess <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-264">water</span>, the
              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-265">starch</span> granules undergo an irreversible phase transition, referred
              to as gelatinization, in which the highly ordered structure is
              disrupted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The extent of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-266">starch</span> gelatinization is the key factor in determining the digestibility and nutritional properties of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-267">starchy</span>
              foods. The <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-268">starch</span>, before being absorbed in the small intestine,
              must be hydrolyzed to its <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates monosaccharide" id="1p-495">monosaccharide</span> components. The
              digestion of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-269">starch</span> begins with salivary <span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-512">amylase</span>, but this activity is much less important than that of pancreatic <span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-513">amylase</span> in
              the small intestine. <span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-514">Amylase</span> hydrolyzes <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-270">starch</span>, with the primary end products being <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates maltose" id="1p-271">maltose</span>, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates maltotriose" id="1p-272">maltotriose</span>, and
              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates alphadextrins" id="1p-273">alphadextrins</span>;
               some <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-274">glucose</span> is also produced. The products of
              alpha-<span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-516">amylase</span> digestion are hydrolyzed into their <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates monosaccharide" id="1p-275">monosaccharide</span> components by <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-276">enzymes</span> expressed on the brash border of the small intestinal cells, the most important of which
              are maltase, sucrase, isomaltase, and lactase. However, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-277">starch</span>
              digestibility is influenced also by the physical structure of food.

            <p>
              <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-287">Pasta</span> is a key component of the traditional Mediterranean diet,
              a dietary pattern that confers health benefits compared to
              current Western dietary patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several decades of observational and intervention studies
              have clarified the characteristics of lifestyles able to prevent
              <span class="mention diseases" about="chronicDisease" id="1p-431">chronic diseases</span> and extend longevity. It is well known that
              both an excess of calorie intake and an inappropriate composition of the habitual diet are relevant for the development of
              <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-426">obesity</span> and other <span class="mention diseases" about="chronicDisease" id="1p-432">chronic diseases</span>. There is a general consensus
              among nutrition scientists and related experts concerning the
              optimal distribution of macronutrients: <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-288">carbohydrates</span> at
              45–60&#37; of calories, <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-289">fats</span> at 25–30&#37; of calories, and <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-290">proteins</span>
              at 15–20&#37; of calories. However, appropriate food choices may
              be more important than the overall amount of each of these
              macronutrients. This implies that avoiding extreme and/or
              unbalanced diets and favoring macronutrient-balanced eating
              patterns are as important as emphasizing the preferential use of
              unsaturated <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-291">fats</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-463">whole grain</span> and low-glycemic index (GI)
              foods, <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-292">fiber</span>-rich <span class="mention food" about="fruit" id="1p-293">fruit</span> and <span class="mention food" about="vegetables" id="1p-294">vegetables</span>, and a combination of
              plant and animal <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-295">protein</span>sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              The GI is a measure of the blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-296">glucose</span>-raising ability of
              the available <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-297">carbohydrates</span> in foods. A large body of evidence
              shows that a diet with a low GI may be able to prevent weight
              gain and reduce the risk of type 2 <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-419">diabetes</span> and <span class="mention diseases" about="CHD" id="1p-420">coronary heart
              disease</span>. GI is calculated by dividing the incremental area under
              the curve (AUC) of blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-298">glucose</span> concentrations, measured
              after the ingestion of a portion of the test food by the AUC of
              blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-299">glucose</span> concentrations achieved with a portion of the
              reference food (<span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-300">glucose</span> or white <span class="mention food" about="bread" id="1p-301">bread</span>). The test and the
              reference food must contain the same amount (50 g) of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-302">carbohydrate</span> and are evaluated in the same group. This index was
              proposed for the first time in 1981 by <span class="mention person" about="DJJenkins" id="1p-316" data-wikidata-id="Q50672984">Jenkins</span> as an alternative
              system for classifying <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-303">carbohydrate</span>-containing foods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-304">carbohydrate</span>-rich foods, <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-305">spaghetti</span> has a lower GI than
              <span class="mention food" about="bread" id="1p-306">bread</span>, <span class="mention food" about="pizza" id="1p-307">pizza</span>, and other cereal foods. The average GI of durum
              wheat <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-308">spaghetti</span> from different manufacturers, cooked 10–15 min
              in <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-309">water</span>, is 46&#37;. Other types of durum wheat <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-310">pasta</span> (i.e., <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="macaroni" id="1p-311">macaroni</span>,
              <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="penne" id="1p-312">penne</span>, and <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="fusilli" id="1p-313">fusilli</span>)
              or fresh <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-314">pasta</span>, made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="SoftWheatFlour" id="1p-315">soft wheat
              flour</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="eggs" id="1p-317">eggs</span>, also have a low GI that ranges from 32&#37; to 47&#37;.
              These values are also superimposable to those of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-464">whole grain</span>
              boiled <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-318">spaghetti</span> (42&#37;) and <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="soy" id="1p-319">soy</span> <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-320">spaghetti</span> (47&#37;). As mentioned
              earlier, the low GI of these products is consistent with a low rate of
              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-321">starch</span> accessibility to digestion, due to the formation of large
               <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-322">protein</span>aggregates surrounding the <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-323">starch</span>. This is relevant since
              it is able to reduce insulin secretion and consequently the risk of
              reactive hypoglycemia during the postabsorption period; moreover, it contributes to increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
              that regulates postprandial satiety and <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-324">glucose</span> metabolism.
            </p>
            <p>
              The majority of the intervention studies, mainly performed
              in high-risk subjects – <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-434">obese</span> subjects or people with
              <span class="mention diseases" about="insulinResistance" id="1p-509">insulin resistance</span>/<span class="mention diseases" about="metabolicSyndrome" id="1p-506">metabolic syndrome</span> – and in <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-436">diabetic</span> patients, have
              shown that a low-GI diet induces favorable changes on body
              weight regulation, blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-325">glucose</span>, and insulin metabolism and
              <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-326">lipid</span> control.
            </p>
            <p>
              A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has demonstrated that a diet with low GI, at least in the medium term
              (&lt; 6 months), promotes a greater <span class="mention diseases" about="weightGain" id="1p-441">weight gain</span> and total <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-327">fat</span>mass
              loss compared to diet with high GI. This result has also been
              confirmed by a systematic review in which the authors evaluated the independent role in body weight reduction of GI and
              other variables of diet in healthy subjects, in <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-328">glucose</span>-intolerant
              subjects, and in type 1 and type 2 <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-437">diabetic</span> patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Epidemiological evidence also suggests that a diet with a
              low GI and rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-329">fiber</span> contributes to <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-421">diabetes</span> prevention and
              to an improvement of the plasma <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-330">lipid</span> profile. The benefits of
              low-GI foods on blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-331">glucose</span> control and other metabolic
              parameters are particularly evident in intervention studies performed in <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-438">diabetic</span> patients and in other high-risk individuals
              compared to healthy subjects. In relation to blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-332">glucose</span>
              control, data clearly show that in <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-439">diabetic</span> patients, low-GI/
              high-<span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-333">fiber</span> diets improve blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-334">glucose</span> concentrations, especially in the postprandial state, reduce the number of hypoglycemic events, and also lower the level of glycated hemoglobin.
              The beneficial metabolic effects of low-GI foods are independent of the <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-335">fiber</span> content. However, a combination in the diet
              of both low-GI and <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-336">fiber</span> -rich foods may enhance the beneficial
              effects of each component. These findings have led some food
              industries to develop new types of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-337">pasta</span> rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-338">fiber</span>, like those
              made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-339">whole grain wheat flour</span> or <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="barley" id="1p-340">barley</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="oat" id="1p-341">oat flour</span>. In
              particular, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-342">pasta</span> made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-343">whole grain wheat flour</span>, beyond
              its content of dietary <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-344">fiber</span>, is also rich in oligosaccharides,
              <span class="mention components minerals" about="minerals" id="1p-345">minerals</span>, <span class="mention components vitamins" about="vitamins" id="1p-346">vitamins</span>, and antioxidant components that may
              have an additional beneficial influence on several biological
              functions. As a matter of fact, the habitual consumption of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-465">whole grain</span> foods is consistently associated with reduced risk
              of developing <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-427">obesity</span>, type 2 <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-422">diabetes</span>, and <span class="mention diseases" about="CVD" id="1p-423">cardiovascular
              diseases</span> in several epidemiological studies. These benefits
              have been related to multiple mechanisms; worth considering
              are (1) the lower energy content of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-466">whole grain</span> products, as
              well as the higher satiating effect, favoring a lower energy
              intake per eating occasion and, in the long term, playing an
              important role in body weight regulation, and (2) the higher
              <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-347">fiber</span>, resistant <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-348">starch</span>, and oligosaccharide content fermented
              by gut microbiota with production of short-chain <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-349">fatty acids</span>
              (SCFA), as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which improve
              the control of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-350">glucose</span> and <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-351">lipid</span> metabolism, decrease gastric
              emptying rate, and increase satiety. In particular, an intervention study, performed in subjects with the <span class="mention diseases" about="metabolicSyndrome" id="1p-507">metabolic syndrome</span>, showed that <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-467">whole grain</span> wheat <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-352">pasta</span> consumed in
              the context of a mixed meal significantly reduces postprandial
              insulin and triglyceride plasma levels, compared to refined
              cereal products. For these reasons, the consumption of whole
              grain foods in the diet has been included in the nutritional
              recommendations of the <span class="mention place" about="USA" id="1p-353" data-wikidata-id="Q30">United States</span> and other countries as a
              dietary strategy targeting the whole population.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beneficial effects on <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-354">glucose</span> and <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-355">lipid</span> metabolism have been
              also reported in subjects consuming <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-356">pasta</span> made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="barley" id="1p-357">barley</span> or
              <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="oat" id="1p-358">oat flour</span>, two cereals particularly rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers betaglucan" id="1p-359">beta-glucan</span>, or <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-360">pasta</span>
              added with guar. These types of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-361">pasta</span>, compared to traditional
              refined wheat <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-362">pasta</span>, induced an even lower increase of plasma
              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-363">glucose</span>, insulin, and triglyceride levels in the postprandial
              period and decreased even more both fasting and postprandial
              plasma <span class="mention components fats" about="fats cholesterol" id="1p-477">cholesterol</span> concentrations. The benefits on <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-364">glucose</span>
              metabolism of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="barley" id="1p-365">barley</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="oat" id="1p-366">oat</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-367">pasta</span> are related to the high
              viscosity of <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers betaglucan" id="1p-368">beta-glucans</span>, which delays gastric emptying and
              limits <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-369">starch</span> accessibility to digestive <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-370">enzymes</span>, thus prolonging
              nutrient digestion and absorption in the small intestine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, consumption of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-371">pasta</span> enriched in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers fructooligosaccharide" id="1p-372">fructooligosaccharides</span> and <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers inulin" id="1p-373">inulin</span> has been proposed as a useful
              tool to prevent inflammatory <span class="mention diseases" about="gastrointestinalDisease" id="1p-430">gastrointestinal diseases</span> and
              <span class="mention diseases" about="cancer" id="1p-429">colon cancer</span>, thanks to its prebiotic effects. The prebiotic activity might have a beneficial impact also on fat storage,
              <span class="mention diseases" about="insulinResistance" id="1p-510">insulin resistance</span>, and subclinical inflammation.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, despite the potential health benefits of new <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-374">pasta</span>
              formulations, it needs to be underlined that the types of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-375">pasta</span>
              commonly available in food shops represent a healthy choice
              among <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-376">carbohydrate</span>-rich foods for their low GI and high
              satiating ability. Moreover, according to the Mediterranean
              tradition, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-377">pasta</span> is the main ingredient of a complex dish in
              which other ingredients are also present, among these being
              <span class="mention food ingredients" about="oliveoil" id="1p-378">olive oil</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="vegetables" id="1p-379">vegetables</span> such as <span class="mention food ingredients" about="tomatoes" id="1p-380">tomatoes</span>, and products of animal
              origin. When animal products like <span class="mention food ingredients" about="fish" id="1p-381">fish</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="cheese" id="1p-382">cheese</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1p-383">meat</span> are
              present in the dish, their amount is usually small and it can be
              considered optimal from the nutritional standpoint, being a
              good source of low-GI <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-384">carbohydrates</span>, rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-385">fiber</span>, and with a
              balanced content of high-quality <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-386">proteins</span> and unsaturated <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-387">fats</span>,
              not to mention micronutrients and polyphenols.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, scientific evidence supports the health benefits of regular <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-388">pasta</span> intake, in particular if it is consumed in the
              context of a diet balanced for energy density and macronutrient distribution, according to the Mediterranean dietary pattern. In fact, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-389">pasta</span>, due to its low GI, represents an ideal source
              of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-390">carbohydrates</span> in the diet of healthy individuals, <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-435">obese</span>
              subjects, and <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-440">diabetic</span> patients. In this context, the alarm
              about the possible dangers of a high consumption of dietary
              <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-391">carbohydrates</span> certainly does not apply, on the basis of the
              available scientific evidence, to healthy carbohydrate-rich
              foods like <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-392">pasta</span>. In contrast, it is strongly advised to favor
              <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-393">pasta</span> consumption, in those countries where its consumption
              is low, in substitution of other carbohydrate foods with higher
              GI. Furthermore, in order to enhance <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-468">whole grain</span> intake in the
              daily diet, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-469">whole grain</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-394">pasta</span> consumption should be considered in addition or in substitution of refined grain <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-395">pasta</span>.
