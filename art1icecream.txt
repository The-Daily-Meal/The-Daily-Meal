Every time that happens, the eating quality diminishes a little. The use of quality <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum" id="ic1-604">gums</span> and <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="hydrocolloid" id="ic1-605">hydrocolloids</span> helps prevent that decline.” Some of the commonly used <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic1-139">stabilizers</span> in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-140">ice cream</span> include <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="agarAgar" id="ic1-141">agar-agar</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum" id="ic1-142">gums</span> like <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="guar" id="ic1-606">guar</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="xanthan" id="ic1-607">xanthan</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gellan" id="ic1-608">gellan</span>, and <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="locustBean" id="ic1-609">locust bean</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="carrageenan" id="ic1-610">carrageenan</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="carboxymethylCellulose" id="ic1-611">carboxymethyl cellulose</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="sodiumAlginate" id="ic1-612">sodium alginate</span>, and <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gelatin" id="ic1-143">gelatin</span>.

The ingredients also help control <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-616">ice crystal</span> growth and improve the texture of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-150">ice cream</span>. Small <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-617">ice crystals</span> result in a smooth and creamy <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-151">ice cream</span> whereas large crystal sizes give <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-152">ice cream</span> a coarse and grainy texture. Product formulations, processing, packaging, and distribution channels can influence the texture and stability of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-153">ice cream</span>, particularly the consistency in size and number of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-618">ice crystals</span> that start off processing with the initial freezing of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-154">ice cream</span>, says <span class="mention person" about="DonnaKlockeman" id="ic1-155">Klockeman</span>. After the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-156">ice cream</span> has fully hardened, changes in temperature affect the size of crystals, she adds. “Even as the product is stored at very low temperatures, there is an equilibrium balance between <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic1-157">water</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-158">ice</span>.” Knowing that <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-619">ice crystal</span> formation affects the appearance, texture, and shelf life of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-159">ice cream</span>, and that it is important to control the size of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-620">ice crystal</span>, ingredient manufacturers have developed <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum" id="ic1-160">gums</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="fiber" id="ic1-161">fibers</span>, and other similar ingredients to address this.

    <p><span class="mention company" about="Fiberstar" id="ic1-190">Fiberstar</span>’s <i>Citri-Fi</i> functional <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="fiber" id="ic1-191">citrus fiber</span> ingredient provides hydrocolloidal properties in dairy applications like <span class="mention food ingredient" about="dairy" id="ic1-192">frozen dairy</span>, including <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-193">ice cream</span> products formulated with reduced amounts of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic1-194">fat</span>. <i>Citri-Fi</i> is produced using a patented, “clean” process that opens up the <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="fiber" id="ic1-195">fiber</span> to create more surface area, and thus, more contact points for <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic1-196">water</span> and/or <span class="mention food ingredient" about="oil" id="ic1-622">oil</span>, explains <span class="mention person" about="AmandaWagner" id="ic1-197">Amanda Wagner</span>, food technologist at <span class="mention company" about="Fiberstar" id="ic1-198">Fiberstar</span>, River Falls, Wis.

    <p>Clean label in food production is an important concern of consumers as they continue to pressure food manufacturers to shorten ingredient statements and formulate with ingredients that are naturally derived and have easy-to-understand names. “For those who are trying to streamline an ingredient legend, <span class="mention company" about="Cargill" id="ic1-211">Cargill</span> offers several ingredients that may offer <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-212">ice cream</span> product developers the right combination of functional and ‘clean,’” says <span class="mention person" about="AnnTigges" id="ic1-214">Tigges</span>. “While ‘clean’ is a subjective descriptor, ingredients like <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum locustBeanGum" id="ic1-215">locust bean gum</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about=" gum guarGum" id="ic1-216">guar gum</span>, and <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic1-217">lecithin</span> have enjoyed a very clean connotation for years.”</p>
    <p><span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum locustBeanGum" id="ic1-218">Locust bean gum</span>, a galactomannan derived from the bean of the locust or carob tree, has been used in foods for thousands of years, says <span class="mention person" about="AnnTigges" id="ic1-219">Tigges</span>. “It is one of the premium <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum" id="ic1-220">gums</span> for use in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-221">ice cream</span>.” Its branching molecular structure traps and holds <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic1-222">water</span>, which helps prevent heat shock. <span class="mention person" about="AnnTigges" id="ic1-223">Tigges</span> adds that <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum locustBeanGum" id="ic1-224">locust bean gum</span> is typically used in combination with <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="gum guarGum" id="ic1-225">guar gum</span> and <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="carrageenan" id="ic1-626">carrageenan</span> but can function as an effective texturant on its own by controlling free <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic1-226">water</span> in a system and contributing to mouthfeel. <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic1-627">Emulsifiers</span> like <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic1-227">lecithin</span> help to hold the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic1-228">fat</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic1-229">water</span> portions of a system in place, which is useful for processing efficiencies. “It is very helpful in achieving or controlling overrun, which is a big component in the manufacture of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-230">ice cream</span>,” says <span class="mention person" about="AnnTigges" id="ic1-231">Tigges</span>. <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic1-232">Lecithin</span> is derived from many sources, including sunflower, which is not genetically modified and not considered an allergen. “This is useful in formulas where <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="monoglyceride" id="ic1-628">mono-</span> and <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="diglyceride" id="ic1-629">diglycerides</span> might not be welcome on the label,” says <span class="mention person" about="AnnTigges" id="ic1-233">Tigges</span>.</p>

    <h3>How <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-234">Sweeteners</span> Affect <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-235">Ice Cream</span></h3>
    <p><span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-236">Ice cream</span> is sweet, and we have <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-237">sugar</span> to thank for that. <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-238">Sugar</span> also plays another important role in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-239">ice cream</span>: to lower the freezing point and prevent the formation of large <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-630">ice crystals</span>. In <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-240">ice cream</span>, the smaller the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic1-631">ice crystals</span>, the smoother the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-241">ice cream</span>. <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-242">Granulated sugar</span> is most often used, but <span class="mention component sweetener" about="dextrose" id="ic1-243">dextrose</span> and <span class="mention component sweetener" about="glucose" id="ic1-244">powdered glucose</span> can be used in combination with <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-245">granulated sugar</span>. <span class="mention food ingredient sweetener" about="cornSyrup" id="ic1-246">Corn syrup</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient sweetener" about="honey" id="ic1-247">honey</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient sweetener" about="mapleSyrup" id="ic1-248">maple syrup</span> are used to sweeten <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-249">ice cream</span>, too. Each <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-250">sweetener</span> contributes a different intensity of sweet taste and quality of sweetness.</p>
    <p>Manufacturers of no-sugar-added and reduced-sugar <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-251">ice cream</span> require different types of <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-252">sweeteners</span> that provide sweet taste levels close to <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-253">sugar</span>, similar functionalities to those of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-254">sugar</span>, and the ability to work along with other types of ingredients. In no-sugar-added and reduced-sugar <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-255">ice cream</span> products, high-intensity <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-256">sweeteners</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-257">sugar</span> alcohols are used. Keep in mind that a challenge in using these <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-258">sweeteners</span> is their effect on the overall texture of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-259">ice cream</span> product.</p>
    <p>“Beyond sweetness, freezing point depression of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-260">sugars</span> is essential in manufacturing <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-261">ice cream</span>s,” says <span class="mention person" about="wadeSchmelzer" id="ic1-262">Wade Schmelzer</span>, principal scientist at <span class="mention company" about="Cargill" id="ic1-263">Cargill</span>, Minneapolis, Minn. (<a href="http://cargill.com/">cargill.com</a>). He explains that alternative <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-264">sweeteners</span> to <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-265">sugar</span> can be used, often with other ingredients, to reduce <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-266">sugar</span> in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-267">ice cream</span> and provide some of the sensory characteristics that <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-268">sugar</span> supplies. For instance, he says that <i>Zerose</i> erythritol can be used to provide the freezing point depression function of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-269">sugar</span> in reduced-sugar <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-270">ice cream</span>s. “Since overall sweetness intensity is an integral part of consumers’ taste expectations, it is frequently coupled with <span class="mention component sweetener" about="stevia" id="ic1-271">stevia leaf extracts</span>,” he explains. “Adjustments to the texturant system may also be necessary to deliver the desired sensory experience. Using this approach, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-272">sugar</span> reductions of up to 25% have been possible, but next-generation <span class="mention component sweetener" about="stevia" id="ic1-273">stevia</span> <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-274">sweeteners</span> with improved sweetness dynamics, such as <span class="mention company" about="Cargill" id="ic1-275">Cargill</span>’s <i>ViaTech</i> products, are creating new opportunities to improve taste and achieve deeper reductions.”</p>
    <p>Other <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-276">sweetener</span> manufacturers feature ingredients for <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-277">sugar</span> reduction in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-278">ice cream</span>. <span class="mention company" about="StevivaIngredients" id="ic1-279">Steviva Ingredients</span>, Portland, Ore. (<a href="http://stevivaingredients.com/">stevivaingredients.com</a>), promotes one of its stevia-based <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-280">sweeteners</span> as an option for use in reducing <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-281">sugar</span> in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-282">ice cream</span> and other <span class="mention food ingredient" about="dairy" id="ic1-283">frozen dairy</span> products. <i>Fructevia</i> is a proprietary blend of <i>SteviaSweet 95/60</i> <span class="mention component sweetener" about="stevia" id="ic1-284">stevia extract</span>, which itself is a blend of 95% steviosides and 60% rebaudioside A, fructose, inulin, and magnesium carbonate. <span class="mention company" about="Ingredion" id="ic1-285">Ingredion</span> developed <i>MALTISWEET IC</i> <span class="mention component sweetener" about="maltitolSyrup" id="ic1-632">maltitol syrup</span> as a replacement for <span class="mention component sweetener" about="sucrose" id="ic1-286">sucrose</span> and <span class="mention component sweetener" about="cornSyrup" id="ic1-287">corn syrup</span> solids in no-sugar- added and reduced-sugar <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-288">ice cream</span> products and <i>ENLITEN Reb A</i> <span class="mention component sweetener" about="stevia" id="ic1-289">stevia</span> <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-290">sweetener</span> as a naturally derived high-potency <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-291">sweetener</span> option, says <span class="mention person" about="IvanGonzales" id="ic1-292">Gonzales</span>. From <span class="mention company" about="Tate&Lyle" id="ic1-293">Tate & Lyle</span>, Hoffman Estates, Ill. (<a href="http://tateandlyle.com/">tateandlyle.com</a>), comes an allulose ingredient called <i>DOLCIA PRIMA</i>. This ingredient, which is made of the monosaccharide allulose, is said to depress the freezing point of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-294">ice cream</span>, soft-serve <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-295">ice cream</span>, and <span class="mention food" about="frozenYogurt" id="ic1-296">frozen yogurt</span> while providing a smooth texture and balanced sweetness and flavor profile. It also works synergistically with other <span class="mention component" about="sweetener" id="ic1-297">sweeteners</span>. And because it has 90% fewer calories than <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic1-298">sugar</span> and is absorbed by the body but not metabolized, the ingredient is well-suited for formulating <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-299">ice cream</span> with reduced calories, according to the company.</p>

In addition to this, she explains that there are a few other trends spotted within this category, which she calls health focus, distinctive characteristics, and a savory approach. Healthier food choices, even for foods that are indulgent, are on the minds of many consumers. “Some products are taking a healthier approach, focusing on the healthy halo for an otherwise sinfully indulgent item with new products touting <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic1-336">protein</span> content, high in <span class="mention component" about="fiber" id="ic1-337">fiber</span>, detox <span class="mention food" about="popsicle" id="ic1-338">popsicles</span> made with <span class="mention food ingredient" about="fruit" id="ic1-339">real fruit</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="vegetable" id="ic1-340">vegetables</span>, and hydration benefits from <span class="mention food ingredient fruit" about="coconutWater" id="ic1-341">coconut water</span>,” she says. Consumers are also seeing emphasis placed on the types of ingredients used in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-342">ice cream</span>. “We are seeing new products flavored with distinctive characteristics and calling out origin such as <span class="mention food ingredient flavour" about="lemon" id="ic1-343">Amalfi lemon</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient flavour" about="chocolate" id="ic1-344">Aztec chocolate</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient flavour" about="vanilla" id="ic1-345">Madagascar bourbon vanilla</span>, providing a premium experience to consumers with unique flavor offerings.” Finally, <span class="mention person" about="PamelaOscarson" id="ic1-346">Oscarson</span> mentions that some manufacturers are formulating with savory ingredients to create a special flavor experience.

    <p>“One way <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-363">ice cream</span> manufacturers can differentiate their products from competitors is by adding texture and flavor with very small chip inclusions.” She adds that the company recently launched colored and flavored small compound chips “that are a smart solution for <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-364">ice cream</span> manufacturers looking to add three effects (texture, color, and flavor) with one ingredient product.” The company also explores new color and flavor combinations. “<span class="mention food ingredient" about="fruits" id="ic1-365">Fruit</span> flavors can complement <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-366">chocolate</span> <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-367">ice cream</span> very well, such as a <span class="mention food ingredient" about="raspberry" id="ic1-368">raspberry</span> <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-369">chocolate</span> <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-370">ice cream</span> bar,” says <span class="mention person" about="LauraBergan" id="ic1-375">Bergan</span>. “Even brown-type flavors, such as a <span class="mention food ingredient" about="mocha" id="ic1-371">mocha</span> coating pair well with a <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-372">chocolate</span> <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-373">ice cream</span> bar. These flavored and colored coatings can also be applied in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-374">ice cream</span> novelty cone products for enhanced color and flavor detail.”</p>
    <p>Consumers are more willing to try flavor combinations that go beyond the traditional. <span class="mention person" about="LauraBergan" id="ic1-376">Bergan</span> suggests exploring sweet and savory and heat and sweet combinations. Some examples she mentioned are <span class="mention food ingredient flavour" about="chocolate" id="ic1-377">salted chocolate</span> as a take on <span class="mention food ingredient flavour" about="caramel" id="ic1-378">salted caramel</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-379">chocolate</span> paired with tea flavors like <span class="mention food ingredient" about="greenTea" id="ic1-380">green tea</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-381">smoked chocolate</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-382">chocolate</span> paired with <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chiliPeppers" id="ic1-383">chili peppers</span>. Consider alcohol-inspired <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic1-636">flavors</span>, too. “<span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-384">Chocolate</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="alcohol" id="ic1-385">alcohol</span> are also indelibly linked, with liquor-filled <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-386">chocolates</span> being category-leaders for decades,” she says. “This can be translated in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-387">ice cream</span> through pairing <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-388">chocolate</span> flavors with <span class="mention food ingredient alcohol" about="redWine" id="ic1-389">red wine</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient alcohol" about="brownSpirit" id="ic1-390">brown spirit</span>, or <span class="mention food ingredient alcohol" about="champagne" id="ic1-391">champagne</span> flavors.”</p>
    <p>The company approaches innovation from both an ingredient development perspective and an applications perspective, allowing it to develop interesting product concepts from its specialty ingredients, says <span class="mention person" about="LauraBergan" id="ic1-402">Bergan</span>. Recently, the company has developed a <span class="mention food flavour" about="coffeeCocoaNib" id="ic1-392">coffee cocoa nib</span> <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-393">ice cream</span> product concept (<span class="mention food flavour" about="vanilla" id="ic1-394">vanilla</span> <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-395">ice cream</span> enrobed in Barry Callebaut’s <span class="mention food ingredient" about="mocha" id="ic1-396">mocha</span>-flavored coating and then rolled in <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cocoaNib" id="ic1-397">cocoa nib</span>) and double-dipped flavored product concepts (<span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-398">ice cream</span> dipped in a <span class="mention food ingredient" about="mocha" id="ic1-399">mocha</span>-flavored coating and then a <span class="mention food ingredient" about="caramel" id="ic1-400">caramel</span> coating). <span class="mention person" about="LauraBergan" id="ic1-401">Bergan</span> explains that manufacturers can use the company’s microchip as a blend-in to create a textured, crunchy ribbon-like effect in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-403">ice cream</span> (a crunchy variegate), <span class="mention food ingredient" about="chocolate" id="ic1-404">chocolate</span> inclusions in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-405">ice cream</span> sandwiches and smaller inclusions as toppings, and colored and flavored <i>EZ</i> melts as blend-ins to make textured <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-406">ice cream</span>.</p>

    <h4>Inclusions for Indulgence</h4>
    <p>One of the things that makes <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-492">ice cream</span> such a special treat is the variety of flavors and inclusions used in the products. Flavor bases and inclusions like <span class="mention food ingredient" about="fruits" id="ic1-493">fruits</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="vegetable" id="ic1-494">vegetables</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="spices" id="ic1-495">spices</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="nuts" id="ic1-496">nuts</span>, variegates (both plain and textured), and even pieces of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cookieDough" id="ic1-497">cookie dough</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="pieCrust" id="ic1-498">pie crust</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="pretzel" id="ic1-499">pretzels</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cookie" id="ic1-500">cookies</span> add something extra to <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-501">ice cream</span> and take products to the next level. Some of these ingredients can even be further flavored or combined with other ingredients as well. <span class="mention company" about="DenaliIngredients" id="ic1-502">Denali Ingredients</span>, New Berlin, Wis. (<a href="http://denaliingredients.com/">denaliingredients.com</a>), shows how its flavor bases, variegates and swirls, and various types of inclusions are used in indulgent, comforting <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic1-503">ice cream</span> varieties.
