        <span class="mention company" about="Technomic" id="2b-38">Technomic</span>, the leading fact-based research firm for the <span class="mention company" about="foodindustry" id="2b-39"> food industry</span>, found in its 2011 <span class="mention report" about="BurgerConsumerTrendReport" id="2b-40">Burger Consumer Trend Report</span> that nearly half of all consumers eat a
        <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-41">burger</span> a week, up from 38 percent two years ago. Additional findings show that consumers—particularly young consumers—want more options in their <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-42">hamburger</span> choices, including
        <span class="mention diets" about="vegetarianism" id="2b-43">vegetarian</span> choices, and they are willing to pay more for these premiums. The top chart on page 73 illustrates Americans’ differential willingness to pay more for certain options. For instance, what <span class="mention animals ingredients" about="cows" id="2b-44">cows</span> eat, how they are raised, and where they come from are important concerns for consumers today.<p>

        <p>These desires have come about through changes in consumer behaviors as a direct result of food-based social movements. In their 2008 Adminstrative Science Quarterly article entitled <span class="mention report" about="ForageforThought" id="2b-45">“Forage for Thought: Mobilizing Codes in the Movement for Grass-fed Meat and Dairy Products</span>,” authors <span class="mention person" about="KlausWeber" id="2b-46">Klaus Weber</span>, <span class="mention person" about="KathyrnHeinze" id="2b-47">Kathyrn Heinze</span> and
        <span class="mention person" about="MichaelaDeSoucey" id="2b-48">Michaela DeSoucey</span> show that social movements create cultural codes around the <span class="mention company" about="beefindustry" id="2b-49">beef industry</span> that require producers to adjust their production standards, as well as provide consumers with ways to make ethical decisions in the marketplace. Through these demands, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="2b-50"> grass-fed beef</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="2b-51">hormone-free beef
        </span>, and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="beef" id="2b-52">steroid-free beef </span>have become staples in the world of <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-53">hamburgers</span>.</p>

        <p>The surge in <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-54">hamburger</span> consumption has been driven by the increased number of better <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-55">burger</span> chains, and the growing availability of
        <span class="mention cuisinetype" about="gourmet" id="2b-56">gourmet</span> <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-57">hamburgers</span> on menus of high-end restaurants across the country.

        </span>, the other chart on this page shows the top 10 fastest growing better
        <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-58">burger</span> chains. The rise of these better <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-59">burger</span> chains is a direct response to consumer demand for more ethical and environmentally friendly <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-60">hamburgers</span>.</p>

        <p>The <span class="mention cuisinetype" about="gourmet" id="2b-61">gourmet</span> <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-62">hamburger</span>, on the other hand, exemplifies an important concept in the sociology of culture, and more specifically food: the notion of <span class="mention diets" about="omnivore" id="2b-63">omnivorousness</span>. Sociologists have described
        <span class="mention diets" about="omnivorousness" id="2b-64">omnivorousness</span> as a type of cultural consumption that allows high-status groups to show off their distinction from other groups through their knowledge of a range of cultural forms, from low culture to high culture. These insights into the sociology of culture have been developed in part from
        <span class="mention person" about="PierreBourdie" id="2b-65" data-wikidata-id="Q156268" data-label="Pierre Bourdie">Pierre Bourdieu</span>’s seminal work Distinction, which showed how aesthetic preferences and cultural tastes were directly related to social class. <span class="mention person" about="PierreBourdie" id="2b-66" data-wikidata-id="Q156268" data-label="Pierre Bourdie">Bourdieu</span> also found that certain cultural preferences were equated with “good taste” and those in privileged class postions often had access to these preferences, while those with less status and wealth did not. As food is a major element of culture in society, the
        <span class="mention food typesofburger" about="burger" id="2b-67">hamburger</span> has become an important container for expressing these preferences in contemporary American cuisine.

        <span class="mention diets" about="omnivore" id="2b-74">omnivorousness</span> operates based on a shared notion of what is legitimate or illegitimate as a <span class="mention cuisinetype" about="gourmet" id="2b-75">gourmet</span> food item. Food legitimacy is based on two criteria: authenticity and exoticism. Authenticity refers to the simplicity of the dish, the geographic region it comes from, the personal connection to the consumer, ethnic connections, history and tradition. Exoticism refers to geographically distant, norm-breaking, and unusual elements of an item. Through the use of these critiria, “foodies” employ a range of cultural knowledge about the products they are consuming as a sign of status in their peer groups and throughout society. <span class="mention person" about="JoséeJohnston" id="2b-76">Johnston</span> and <span class="mention person" about="ShyonBaumann" id="2b-77">Baumann
