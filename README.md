# The-Daily-Meal

Repository dedicated to the Information Modeling and Web Technologies course taught by Prof. Fabio Vitali at the University of Bologna for the year 2020-2021.

*[The Daily Meal](https://the-daily-meal.github.io/)* is a magazine about food, with currently three issues, respectively about Pasta, Hamburger and Ice Cream. The magazine can adopt 6 different typographic styles, by clicking on each button of the navbar. For each issue, a metadata viewer allows the user to select topics and compare them among the articles. 

The website is following the LLLL: Leisurely Luscious Literary Lens framework: 

* Lens – This project is not about ONE issue of ONE magazine. It is meant
as a repeatable and parametrized lens to evaluate different aspects of 
the same issue by reading and comparing side by side different articles
on the same topic. 
* Literary – An open set of analysis criteria over the article should be 
possible, the most important of which is authority and keyword 
analysis. Other include sentiment analysis, rhetorical tricks, etc. 
* Luscious – Abundant, rich, interesting comparisons must be possible.
* Leisure – The system should be fun and interesting, it does not have to 
be just serious and formal. We focus also on trivia, silly
and funny aspects.
