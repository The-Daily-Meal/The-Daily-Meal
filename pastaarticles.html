                  <p>
                    <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-1">Pasta</span> is an ancient food widely consumed in the world and
                    represents one of the staple foods of the Mediterranean diet.
                    There are many theories concerning its origin. Some researchers
                    place its origin in the thirteenth century by <span class="mention person" about="MarcoPolo" id="1p-2" data-wikidata-id="Q6101">Marco Polo</span>, who
                    introduced <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-3">pasta</span> in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-414" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> upon returning from one of his trips to
                    <span class="mention place" about="China" id="1p-4" data-wikidata-id="Q29520">China</span> in 1271. However, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-5">pasta</span> dates much further back, maybe
                    to the ancient Etruscans, who made <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-6">pasta</span> by grinding several
                    <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-7">cereals</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="grains" id="1p-8">grains</span> and then mixing them with <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-9">water</span>, a blend
                    that was later on cooked producing a tasty and nutritious food.
                    The term ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="macaroni" id="1p-10">macaroni</span>,’ which is currently referred to as a long type
                    of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-11">pasta</span>, is found in the documents of Roman writers since the
                    first centuries ‘after Christ.’ However, both the Etruscans and the
                    Romans baked their <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="noodles" id="1p-12">noodles</span> in an oven, so boiled <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-13">pasta</span> had yet
                    to be born in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-14" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span>. As the centuries went by, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-15">pasta</span> continued to
                    appear on the tables of <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-415" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> with different names. For example,
                    in 1400, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-16">pasta</span> was called ‘lasagna’ and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-17">pasta</span> manufacturers were
                    referred to as ‘lasagnare,’ while in 1800, their name turned into
                    ‘vermicellai.’ Between 1400 and 1800, a new kind of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-18">pasta</span>, that
                    is, ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="fidelli" id="1p-19">fidelli</span>,’ started being manufactured besides ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="lasagne" id="1p-20">lasagne</span>’ and
                    ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="vermicelli" id="1p-21">vermicelli</span>.’ ‘<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="fidelli" id="1p-489">Fidelli</span>’ were <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-22">pasta</span> threads with a cylindrical shape,
                    and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-23">pasta</span> manufacturers became known as ‘fidellai.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the American historian <span class="mention person" about="CharlesPerry" data-wikidata-id="Q57205426" id="1p-24">Charles Perry</span>, who has
                    written several articles on the origins of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-25">pasta</span>, the first clear
                    western reference to boiled <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="noodles" id="1p-26">noodles</span> is in the Jerusalem Talmud
                    of the fifth century AD written in Aramaic for which the term
                    ‘itriyah’ was used. By the tenth century, ‘itriyah’ in many Arabic
                    sources referred to dried <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="noodles" id="1p-490">noodles</span> bought from a vendor, as
                    opposed to fresh ones made at home.

                      <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-28">Pasta</span> is mainly produced with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-29">wheat flour</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-30">water</span>:

                      and/or other optional ingredients can also be added. <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-32">Pasta</span> manufacturers typically use <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-33">milled durum wheat (semolina)</span>
                      although <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="SoftWheatFlour" id="1p-34">soft wheat flour</span> and other <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-35">cereal flours</span> are also
                      used. <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-36">pasta</span> traditionally consumed in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="1p-37" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> is made exclusively
                      with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-38">durum wheat flour</span>, while in other countries, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-39">pasta</span> made
                      from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="SoftWheatFlour" id="1p-40">soft wheat</span> and/or other <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-41">cereal flours</span> are also frequently
                      consumed. <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-42">Durum wheat</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-43">pasta</span> is made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-43">durum wheat
                      semolina</span> (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> L. <i>var. durum</i>) to which <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="water" id="1p-43">water</span> is
                      added, the reactant, that allows modification of <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins gluten" id="1p-44">gluten</span> via the
                      input of mechanical and thermal energy to produce <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-45">pasta</span>.
                      Wheat <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-416">proteins</span> help with strengthening <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-46">pasta</span> structure by
                      means of entangled aggregation. <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-479">Starch</span>, the major component
                      of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-47">semolina</span> and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-48">pasta</span>, occurs in the form of granules dispersed
                      within the <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-49">protein</span> network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-50">pasta</span> processing consists of three main operations: (1)
                      hydrating and mixing–kneading of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-51">semolina</span> to make a
                      dough (formation of <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins gluten" id="1p-52">gluten</span> network), (2) shaping the dough
                      through extrusion, and (3) stabilizing the shaped <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-53">pasta</span> pieces,
                      usually by drying. This sequence of operations is developed in
                      an industrial automated scale. The process of hydrating and
                      mixing–kneading of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-54">semolina</span> produces a homogeneous
                      hydrated dough that is essential for producing high-quality
                      <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-55">pasta</span>. To obtain the most homogeneous hydrated mass, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-56">semolina</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-57">water</span> first undergo high-speed premixing (using a
                      single or double shaft, vertical or horizontal) to ensure intimate contact between <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-58">semolina</span> particles and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-59">water</span> droplets.
                      Further mixing then takes place in the main mixing unit,
                      generally under vacuum, that removes air bubbles before the
                      mass passes in the extrusion section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After the dough is mixed, it is transferred to the extruder in
                      order to obtain a specific form (<span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-60">spaghetti</span>, <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="macaroni" id="1p-61">macaroni</span>, etc.) with
                      the development of a continuous network of <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins gluten" id="1p-62">gluten</span>  <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-417">protein</span>that
                      surrounds the <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-480">starch</span> granules. This process facilitates maintenance of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-63">pasta</span> structure during cooking. The extrusion auger
                      forces the dough through the die under high pressure, followed
                      by cutting. The die holes are designed to give <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-64">pasta</span> the desired
                      shape and size. Compression and extrusion are obtained with
                      different machines. Until recently, most dies were made of
                      bronze, which was relatively soft and required repair or periodic
                      replacement. Recently, dies have been improved by fitting the
                      extruding surface of the die with Teflon&#174; inserts to extend the
                      life of the dies and improve <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-65">pasta</span> quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Drying is the most difficult and critical step to control in the
                      <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-66">pasta</span> production process. Drying consists of passing a flow of
                      hot or warm air over the fresh <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-67">pasta</span> product, so that the
                      thermohygrometric properties of the air progressively decrease
                      the <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-68">pasta</span> moisture content at a level acceptable for dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-69">pasta</span>.
                      Nowadays, the majority of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-70">pasta</span>-drying processes adopt air
                      temperatures in the range of about 70–100 &#176;C while keeping
                      product temperatures between 60 and 90 &#176;C. The objective of
                      drying is to lower the moisture content of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-71">pasta</span> from &#8764;31&#37; to
                      12–13&#37;, so that the finished product is hard, retains its shape,
                      and can be stored without spoiling. Dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-72">pasta</span> stored at room
                      temperature is stable for years at room temperature.

                      The best <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-73">pasta</span> is produced from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="1p-74">durum wheat semolina</span>,
                      due to the dough excellent rheological properties, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-75">pasta</span> superior color, cooking quality, and consumer acceptance.

                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-238">Starch</span> is the most abundant nutrient in <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="239">pasta</span> and the source
                      of rapidly released <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="240">glucose</span> during digestion, regardless of the
                      type of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="cereals" id="1p-241">cereal</span> used. The <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-242">starch</span> of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-243">pasta</span> contains two major
                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-244">glucose polymers</span>, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-245">amylose</span> and <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-246">amylopectin</span>, which differ in
                      the degree of polymerization (DP) of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-247">glucose</span> chains and in
                      the frequency of branches. In particular, wheat endosperm contains &#8764;75–80&#37; of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-248">starch</span> as <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-249">amylopectin</span> and 20–25&#37; as <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-250">amylose</span>.
                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-251">Amylose</span> is a predominantly linear molecule with <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-252">glucose</span>
                      chains linked through alpha-1,4 linkages in the range of
                      1000–2000 DP, while <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-256">amylopectin</span> is a complex and highly
                      branched molecule in the range of 50000–500 000 DP. In <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylopectin" id="1p-257">amylopectin</span>, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-258">glucose</span> units are linked in a linear way with alpha-1,4 linkages. Branching takes place with alpha-1,6 bonds occurring
                      every 24–30 <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-259">glucose</span> units, resulting in a soluble molecule that
                      can be quickly degraded since it has many end points for
                      <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-260">enzymes</span> to attach onto. In contrast, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose amylose" id="1p-261">amylose</span> contains very few
                      alpha-1,6 bonds or even none at all. This causes it to be hydrolyzed more slowly but to have a higher density and to be
                      insoluble. In raw products, native <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-262">starch</span> occurs naturally as
                      insoluble semicrystalline granules assembled in some way to
                      form an ordered granular architecture and is not digested by
                      human bowel <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-263">enzymes</span>. When it is heated in excess <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="1p-264">water</span>, the
                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-265">starch</span> granules undergo an irreversible phase transition, referred
                      to as gelatinization, in which the highly ordered structure is
                      disrupted.

                      The extent of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-266">starch</span> gelatinization is the key factor in determining the digestibility and nutritional properties of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-267">starchy</span>
                      foods. The <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-268">starch</span>, before being absorbed in the small intestine,
                      must be hydrolyzed to its <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates monosaccharide" id="1p-495">monosaccharide</span> components. The
                      digestion of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-269">starch</span> begins with salivary <span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-512">amylase</span>, but this activity is much less important than that of pancreatic <span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-513">amylase</span> in
                      the small intestine. <span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-514">Amylase</span> hydrolyzes <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-270">starch</span>, with the primary end products being <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates maltose" id="1p-271">maltose</span>, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates maltotriose" id="1p-272">maltotriose</span>, and
                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates alphadextrins" id="1p-273">alphadextrins</span>;
                       some <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-274">glucose</span> is also produced. The products of
                      alpha-<span class="components proteins" about="proteins enzymes amylase" id="1p-516">amylase</span> digestion are hydrolyzed into their <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates monosaccharide" id="1p-275">monosaccharide</span> components by <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-276">enzymes</span> expressed on the brash border of the small intestinal cells, the most important of which
                      are maltase, sucrase, isomaltase, and lactase. However, <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-277">starch</span>
                      digestibility is influenced also by the physical structure of food.
                      In the case of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-278">pasta</span>, molecular rearrangements of <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-279">proteins</span> may
                      lead to the formation of large  <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-280">protein</span>aggregates, which reduce

                      <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-287">Pasta</span> is a key component of the traditional Mediterranean diet,
                      a dietary pattern that confers health benefits compared to
                      current Western dietary patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Several decades of observational and intervention studies
                      have clarified the characteristics of lifestyles able to prevent
                      <span class="mention diseases" about="chronicDisease" id="1p-431">chronic diseases</span> and extend longevity. It is well known that
                      both an excess of calorie intake and an inappropriate composition of the habitual diet are relevant for the development of
                      <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-426">obesity</span> and other <span class="mention diseases" about="chronicDisease" id="1p-432">chronic diseases</span>. There is a general consensus
                      among nutrition scientists and related experts concerning the
                      optimal distribution of macronutrients: <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-288">carbohydrates</span> at
                      45–60&#37; of calories, <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-289">fats</span> at 25–30&#37; of calories, and <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-290">proteins</span>
                      at 15–20&#37; of calories. However, appropriate food choices may
                      be more important than the overall amount of each of these
                      macronutrients. This implies that avoiding extreme and/or
                      unbalanced diets and favoring macronutrient-balanced eating
                      patterns are as important as emphasizing the preferential use of
                      unsaturated <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-291">fats</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-463">whole grain</span> and low-glycemic index (GI)

                    <p>
                      The GI is a measure of the blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-296">glucose</span>-raising ability of
                      the available <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-297">carbohydrates</span> in foods. A large body of evidence
                      shows that a diet with a low GI may be able to prevent weight
                      gain and reduce the risk of type 2 <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-419">diabetes</span> and <span class="mention diseases" about="CHD" id="1p-420">coronary heart
                      disease</span>. GI is calculated by dividing the incremental area under
                      the curve (AUC) of blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-298">glucose</span> concentrations, measured
                      after the ingestion of a portion of the test food by the AUC of
                      blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-299">glucose</span> concentrations achieved with a portion of the
                      reference food (<span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-300">glucose</span> or white <span class="mention food" about="bread" id="1p-301">bread</span>). The test and the
                      reference food must contain the same amount (50 g) of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-302">carbohydrate</span> and are evaluated in the same group. This index was
                      proposed for the first time in 1981 by <span class="mention person" about="DJJenkins" id="1p-316" data-wikidata-id="Q50672984">Jenkins</span> as an alternative

Other types of durum wheat <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-310">pasta</span> (i.e., <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="macaroni" id="1p-311">macaroni</span>,

                      These values are also superimposable to those of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-464">whole grain</span>
                      boiled <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-318">spaghetti</span> (42&#37;) and <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="soy" id="1p-319">soy</span> <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="1p-320">spaghetti</span> (47&#37;). As mentioned
                      earlier, the low GI of these products is consistent with a low rate of
                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-321">starch</span> accessibility to digestion, due to the formation of large

                      it is able to reduce insulin secretion and consequently the risk of
                      reactive hypoglycemia during the postabsorption period; moreover, it contributes to increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
                      that regulates postprandial satiety and <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-324">glucose</span> metabolism.

                      The majority of the intervention studies, mainly performed
                      in high-risk subjects – <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-434">obese</span> subjects or people with

                      shown that a low-GI diet induces favorable changes on body
                      weight regulation, blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-325">glucose</span>, and insulin metabolism and

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has demonstrated that a diet with low GI, at least in the medium term
                      (&lt; 6 months), promotes a greater <span class="mention diseases" about="weightGain" id="1p-441">weight gain</span> and total <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-327">fat</span>mass
                      loss compared to diet with high GI. This result has also been
                      confirmed by a systematic review in which the authors evaluated the independent role in body weight reduction of GI and
                      other variables of diet in healthy subjects, in <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-328">glucose</span>-intolerant
                      subjects, and in type 1 and type 2 <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-437">diabetic</span> patients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Epidemiological evidence also suggests that a diet with a
                      low GI and rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-329">fiber</span> contributes to <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-421">diabetes</span> prevention and
                      to an improvement of the plasma <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-330">lipid</span> profile. The benefits of
                      low-GI foods on blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-331">glucose</span> control and other metabolic
                      parameters are particularly evident in intervention studies performed in <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-438">diabetic</span> patients and in other high-risk individuals
                      compared to healthy subjects. In relation to blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-332">glucose</span>
                      control, data clearly show that in <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-439">diabetic</span> patients, low-GI/
                      high-<span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-333">fiber</span> diets improve blood <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-334">glucose</span> concentrations, especially in the postprandial state, reduce the number of hypoglycemic events, and also lower the level of glycated hemoglobin.
                      The beneficial metabolic effects of low-GI foods are independent of the <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-335">fiber</span> content. However, a combination in the diet
                      of both low-GI and <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-336">fiber</span> -rich foods may enhance the beneficial
                      effects of each component. These findings have led some food
                      industries to develop new types of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-337">pasta</span> rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-338">fiber</span>, like those
                      made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-339">whole grain wheat flour</span> or <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="barley" id="1p-340">barley</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="oat" id="1p-341">oat flour</span>. In
                      particular, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-342">pasta</span> made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-343">whole grain wheat flour</span>, beyond
                      its content of dietary <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-344">fiber</span>, is also rich in oligosaccharides,
                      <span class="mention components minerals" about="minerals" id="1p-345">minerals</span>, <span class="mention components vitamins" about="vitamins" id="1p-346">vitamins</span>, and antioxidant components that may
                      have an additional beneficial influence on several biological
                      functions. As a matter of fact, the habitual consumption of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-465">whole grain</span> foods is consistently associated with reduced risk
                      of developing <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-427">obesity</span>, type 2 <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-422">diabetes</span>, and <span class="mention diseases" about="CVD" id="1p-423">cardiovascular
                      diseases</span> in several epidemiological studies. These benefits
                      have been related to multiple mechanisms; worth considering
                      are (1) the lower energy content of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-466">whole grain</span> products, as
                      well as the higher satiating effect, favoring a lower energy
                      intake per eating occasion and, in the long term, playing an
                      important role in body weight regulation, and (2) the higher
                      <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-347">fiber</span>, resistant <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-348">starch</span>, and oligosaccharide content fermented
                      by gut microbiota with production of short-chain <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-349">fatty acids</span>
                      (SCFA), as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which improve
                      the control of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-350">glucose</span> and <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-351">lipid</span> metabolism, decrease gastric
                      emptying rate, and increase satiety. In particular, an intervention study, performed in subjects with the <span class="mention diseases" about="metabolicSyndrome" id="1p-507">metabolic syndrome</span>, showed that <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-467">whole grain</span> wheat <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-352">pasta</span> consumed in
                      the context of a mixed meal significantly reduces postprandial
                      insulin and triglyceride plasma levels, compared to refined
                      cereal products. For these reasons, the consumption of whole
                      grain foods in the diet has been included in the nutritional
                      recommendations of the <span class="mention place" about="USA" id="1p-353" data-wikidata-id="Q30">United States</span> and other countries as a
                      dietary strategy targeting the whole population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Beneficial effects on <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-354">glucose</span> and <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-355">lipid</span> metabolism have been
                      also reported in subjects consuming <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-356">pasta</span> made from <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="barley" id="1p-357">barley</span> or
                      <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="oat" id="1p-358">oat flour</span>, two cereals particularly rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers betaglucan" id="1p-359">beta-glucan</span>, or <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-360">pasta</span>
                      added with guar. These types of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-361">pasta</span>, compared to traditional
                      refined wheat <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-362">pasta</span>, induced an even lower increase of plasma
                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-363">glucose</span>, insulin, and triglyceride levels in the postprandial
                      period and decreased even more both fasting and postprandial
                      plasma <span class="mention components" about="cholesterol" id="1p-477">cholesterol</span> concentrations. The benefits on <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates glucose" id="1p-364">glucose</span>
                      metabolism of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="barley" id="1p-365">barley</span> and <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="oat" id="1p-366">oat</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-367">pasta</span> are related to the high
                      viscosity of <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers betaglucan" id="1p-368">beta-glucans</span>, which delays gastric emptying and
                      limits <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="1p-369">starch</span> accessibility to digestive <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins enzymes" id="1p-370">enzymes</span>, thus prolonging
                      nutrient digestion and absorption in the small intestine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, consumption of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-371">pasta</span> enriched in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers fructooligosaccharide" id="1p-372">fructooligosaccharides</span> and <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers inulin" id="1p-373">inulin</span> has been proposed as a useful
                      tool to prevent inflammatory <span class="mention diseases" about="gastrointestinalDisease" id="1p-430">gastrointestinal diseases</span> and
                      <span class="mention diseases" about="cancer" id="1p-429">colon cancer</span>, thanks to its prebiotic effects. The prebiotic activity might have a beneficial impact also on fat storage,
                      <span class="mention diseases" about="insulinResistance" id="1p-510">insulin resistance</span>, and subclinical inflammation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, despite the potential health benefits of new <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-374">pasta</span>
                      formulations, it needs to be underlined that the types of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-375">pasta</span>
                      commonly available in food shops represent a healthy choice
                      among <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-376">carbohydrate</span>-rich foods for their low GI and high
                      satiating ability. Moreover, according to the Mediterranean
                      tradition, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-377">pasta</span> is the main ingredient of a complex dish in
                      which other ingredients are also present, among these being
                      <span class="mention food ingredients" about="oliveoil" id="1p-378">olive oil</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="vegetables" id="1p-379">vegetables</span> such as <span class="mention food ingredients" about="tomatoes" id="1p-380">tomatoes</span>, and products of animal
                      origin. When animal products like <span class="mention food ingredients" about="fish" id="1p-381">fish</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients" about="cheese" id="1p-382">cheese</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="meat" id="1p-383">meat</span> are
                      present in the dish, their amount is usually small and it can be
                      considered optimal from the nutritional standpoint, being a
                      good source of low-GI <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-384">carbohydrates</span>, rich in <span class="mention components fibers" about="fibers" id="1p-385">fiber</span>, and with a
                      balanced content of high-quality <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="1p-386">proteins</span> and unsaturated <span class="mention components fats" about="fats" id="1p-387">fats</span>,
                      not to mention micronutrients and polyphenols.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, scientific evidence supports the health benefits of regular <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-388">pasta</span> intake, in particular if it is consumed in the
                      context of a diet balanced for energy density and macronutrient distribution, according to the Mediterranean dietary pattern. In fact, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-389">pasta</span>, due to its low GI, represents an ideal source
                      of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-390">carbohydrates</span> in the diet of healthy individuals, <span class="mention diseases" about="obesity" id="1p-435">obese</span>
                      subjects, and <span class="mention diseases" about="diabetes" id="1p-440">diabetic</span> patients. In this context, the alarm
                      about the possible dangers of a high consumption of dietary
                      <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates" id="1p-391">carbohydrates</span> certainly does not apply, on the basis of the
                      available scientific evidence, to healthy carbohydrate-rich
                      foods like <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-392">pasta</span>. In contrast, it is strongly advised to favor
                      <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-393">pasta</span> consumption, in those countries where its consumption
                      is low, in substitution of other carbohydrate foods with higher
                      GI. Furthermore, in order to enhance <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-468">whole grain</span> intake in the
                      daily diet, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="1p-469">whole grain</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-394">pasta</span> consumption should be considered in addition or in substitution of refined grain <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-395">pasta</span>.

                  ‘‘<span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-26">Pasta</span>,’’ Italian for ‘‘dough,’’ is typically thought of as an
                  Italian staple, and for good reason. According to the <span class="mention organization" about="NPA" id="2p-27">National Pasta Association</span>, Italian per-capita consumption of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-28">pasta</span>

                  per year, putting them seventh of the 47 countries. Although

                <p>
                  Originally, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-63">pasta</span> was made by grinding several <span class="mention food ingredients" about="cereals" id="2p-64">cereals</span> and
                  <span class="mention food ingredients" about="grains" id="2p-65">grains</span> together and mixing them with <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="2p-66">water</span> before cooking.<a href=#6p><sup>6</sup></a>
                  Today, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-67">durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> L.)</span> is the preferred
                  raw material worldwide and is grown specifically for the
                  manufacturing of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-68">pasta</span>. Compared with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="SoftWheatFlour" id="2p-69">common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L)</span>
                  , which is used to make <span class="mention food" about="bread" id="2p-70">bread</span> and
                  <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="noodles" id="2p-71">oriental-style noodles</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-72">durum wheat</span> is harder, and milling
                  produces a coarse particle called <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-73">semolina</span>, a golden yellow
                  flour, which is then used to make <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-74">pasta</span>. <span class="mention food" about="couscous" id="2p-75">Couscous</span> is <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-76">semolina</span> cooked with <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="2p-76">water</span>.
                  The compact structure of <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-77">semolina</span>,
                  produced from high-<span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="2p-597">protein</span> <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-78">durum wheat</span>, allows <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-79">pasta</span> to
                  maintain its cooking consistency, flavor, and texture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The production of good-quality <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-80">pasta</span> begins with the
                  milling of high-quality <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-81">durum wheat</span>. Before milling, the
                  <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-82">durum wheat</span> kernels are cleaned of any foreign substances
                  coming from the field and are then brushed to clean the
                  external layer of the bran. As the wheat is fed into a mill,
                  rollers remove the bran and germ, while the endosperm is cracked into coarse pieces. Through sifting, the endosperm
                  particles are separated from the bran and ground, creating
                  <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-83">semolina flour</span> of the correct particle size and quality.<a href=#7p><sup>7</sup></a> The
                  <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-84">semolina</span> is then mixed with <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="2p-85">water</span> to form a dough, which
                  is kneaded to bring it to the proper consistency. High<span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="2p-598">protein</span> <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-86">durum wheat</span> is desirable because it generally
                  yields a <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="2p-87">semolina</span> of uniform size with a minimum number
                  of <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="2p-599">starchy</span> particles and thus will hydrate evenly during
                  mixing.<a href=#7p><sup>7</sup></a> The kneaded dough is then extruded through a
                  ‘‘laminator’’ for flat shapes, such as <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="lasagne" id="2p-88">lasagna</span> and <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="tagliatelle" id="2p-89">tagliatelle</span>,
                  or through various molds or dies to give the desired shape
                  for other <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-90">pasta</span> varieties (round dies for short <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-91">pastas</id>, rectangular for long <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-92">pastas</span>). The extrusion process creates a
                  tight <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="2p-93">protein</span> shield around the <span class="mention components carbohydrates" about="carbohydrates starch" id="2p-600">starch</span> molecules to provide
                  <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-94">pasta</span>’s strong, elastic structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The extruded dough is sent through dryers that circulate hot air for several hours to keep the dough from
                  sticking and forming lumps and to strengthen the <span class="mention components proteins" about="proteins" id="2p-601">protein</span>
                  shield. Drying <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-95">pasta</span>, which ensures it is strong and will
                  have a long storage life, is the most delicate step of the
                  entire production process.<a href=#7p><sup>7</sup></a> The drying of short <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-96">pasta</span> occurs in steps as it is moved along dryer belts. Long <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-97">pasta</span>
                  requires a longer drying time because of its thickness. It is
                  hung on sticks and then cut to length at the end of the
                  drying process. If <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-98">pasta</span> is not dried properly, cracking
                  may develop.<a href=#7p><sup>7</sup></a> The <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-99">pasta</span> is moved through a number of
                  drying zones that are maintained at a precise temperature
                  and relative humidity to reduce the moisture to about
                  12%. Drying time can vary greatly (4&ndash;48 hours) depending
                  on the shape and length of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-100">pasta</span>. From there, the <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-101">pasta</span> is
                  sent to automatic packing machines to be weighed and
                  packed in boxes or bags. There are more than 600 <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="1p-102">pasta</span>
                  shapes produced worldwide, but the most popular in the
                  <span class="mention place" about="USA" id="2p-103" data-wikidata-id="Q30">United States</span> are <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="2p-204">spaghetti</span>, thin <span class="mention food typesofpasta" about="spaghetti" id="2p-105">spaghetti</span>,

                  A more recent <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-139">pasta</span> option is precooked <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-140">pasta</span> in a pouch,
                  which is packaged fully cooked and can be microwaved

                  and because it is ready to eat in less time than traditional
                  <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="2p-142">pasta</span>, it uses less energy. <span class="mention organization" about="barilla" id="2p-616">Barilla</span> Ready-Pasta, for example,

                  and intercropping, to increase productivity and crop quality

                  Only quality certified seeds were used, and sustainability was extended to whole farms, not only to single

                  and production costs could be reduced by up to 30%,
                  according to the specific climatic conditions year to year.
                  Production yields increased by up to 20%, according to
                  year-to-year specific conditions, with improved revenue
                  for farmers. Since 2012, this system has succeeded in reducing the environmental impacts, increasing profits and

                  A systematic review of prospective cohort studies and

                  <p>
                    My love for food started from a <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-1">pasta</span> dish. I watched while my mother, an
                    excellent cook from whom I inherited the passion for cooking, prepared
                    delicious meals. They were always different, and she paid great attention and
                    the care to cook even the most seemingly simple dishes, such as <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-2">pasta</span>, and I
                    learned by observing and memorizing her gestures.

                    I especially liked to wait for the water to boil, and then, while the <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-3">pasta</span>
                    was cooking, I stared at the pot, contemplating the delicious dish to come.
                    Tasting <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-4">pasta</span> during cooking was another rite to make sure it was al
                    dente. The fact that my mother gave value to my judgment, when I was only a
                    child, meant a lot. Growing up, I realized she wanted, slowly, to involve me
                    in the kitchen because the “independence” of each of us also begins in being
                    able to prepare a meal to feed ourselves. Tasting the <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-5">pasta</span> was a sort of
                    initiation and has been one of the most important lessons.

                    “You mustn’t be distracted. You have to follow the cooking because even a
                    minute longer can be enough to overcook <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-6">pasta</span>”- said my mother- “if <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-7">pasta</span> is
                    overcooked it will taste like glue and even the best seasoning will not give
                    flavor to the dish.”
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="3p-aldente">
                  <h4 class="section_heading"><b><span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-185">Pasta</span>: the importance of being <em>al dente</em></b></h4>
                  <p>
                    Al dente is the term for the perfect <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-8">pasta</span> cooking and is also the word that
                    my mother often said to make sure I did not forget this first basic rule.

                    But even before the cooking is the choice of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-9">pasta</span> to make a difference. In
                    <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="3p-10" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span>, there are many shapes, sizes and brands. There are national brands and
                    those products within each Italian region. The quality is top-notch but there
                    is always one brand better than another. The quality of grain (in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="3p-11" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span>,
                    <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-12">pasta</span> is only made with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="3p-12">durum wheat</span>) and <span class="mention food ingredients" about="water" id="3p-13">water</span> are the two most important
                    ingredients by which one has to judge the excellence of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-14">pasta</span>. Sometimes, it
                    is difficult even for Italians to choose between the shelves of supermarkets
                    offering dozens and dozens of types of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-15">pasta</span>. My mother has always had very
                    clear ideas on her favorites and I was educated to choose with critical eyes.
                    Even as a child I was used to eating organic <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="3p-16">durum wheat</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-17">pasta</span>, <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="wholeWheat" id="3p-18">whole wheat</span>
                    <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-19">pasta</span>, and <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-20">pasta</span> made with ancient grains. As an adult, I also discovered

                  <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-26">Pasta</span> is the best known symbol of Italian cuisine. Abroad, it is customary to
                  believe that fresh<span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-27">pasta</span> is more popular than dry <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-28">pasta</span>. In truth, it is not
                  so. Strictly prepared with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="3p-29">durum wheat</span>, dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-30">pasta</span>, cooked al dente, and
                  combined with not too elaborate sauces is one of the signature dishes of the
                  Mediterranean Diet (<a href="https://ich.unesco.org/">UNESCO Intangible Heritage</a>), a dish that Italians consume
                  daily. The common belief of foreigners is that <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-31">pasta</span> (like <span class="mention food" about="pizza" id="3p-32">pizza</span>) makes you
                  fat. However, many Italians eat a plate of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-33">pasta</span> once a day and are among the
                  longest-lived people in the world (along with the Japanese) and are some of
                  the less obese in the world. The <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-34">pasta</span>’s condiments of the Mediterranean Diet
                  are also fresh and seasonal, proving to be a healthy and simple option for a

                    <p>
                      Arabs introduced the use of dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-105">pasta</span> to <span class="mention place" about="Sicily" id="3p-106" data-wikidata-id="Q1460">Western Sicily</span>, although <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-107">pasta</span> had
                      been eaten since the Greeks and Romans under the name of “Lagana”, similar to

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Over the centuries, <span class="mention place" about="Sicily" id="3p-109" data-wikidata-id="Q1460">Sicily</span> and <span class="mention place" about="Liguria" id="3p-110" data-wikidata-id="Q1256">Liguria</span> regions have given rise to the spread
                      of dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-111">pasta</span> in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="3p-112" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span>. Both Sicilians and Ligurians moved to sea and had the need for supplies that lasted a long time, occupied little space and had
                      a high energy input. The drying process in these regions has been favored by a perfect Mediterranean climate. At that time, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-113">pasta</span> was made with <span class="mention food ingredients flour" about="DurumWheatFlour" id="3p-114">semolina flour</span>. The producer sat down on a bench and used his feet to mix and knead the dough.
                      <span class="mention place" about="Naples" id="3p-115" data-wikidata-id="Q2634">Naples</span> was one of the cities that first imported <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-116">pasta</span> from <span class="mention place" about="Sicily" id="3p-117" data-wikidata-id="Q1460">Sicily</span>
                      and it also was the city that, in 1600, marked a turning point for the
                      production of dried <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-118">pasta</span> (in Italian: “Pasta secca”) as a typical product of Italian culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In <span class="mention place" about="Naples" id="3p-119" data-wikidata-id="Q2634">Naples</span>, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-120">pasta</span> was lying in the reeds exposed to sunlight or fresh air.
                      Soon, <span class="mention place" about="Gragnano" id="3p-121" data-wikidata-id="Q72128">Gragnano</span>, a small town near <span class="mention place" about="Naples" id="3p-122" data-wikidata-id="Q2634">Naples</span>, became famous, first in <span class="mention place" about="Italy" id="3p-123" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> and
                      then all over the world, for its high quality <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-124">pasta</span>, thanks to perfect
                      weather (sun, wind and the right humidity). In the past, the main streets of
                      this small city were designed specifically to be best used for the natural
                      drying of <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-125">pasta</span>, with special exposure to the sun. <span class="mention place" about="Gragnano" id="3p-126" data-wikidata-id="Q72128">Gragnano</span> <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-127">pasta</span> (nowadays

                      Italian food) is obtained by grinding the wheat grown in specially demarcated
                      areas and reducing it to flour. Flour is mixed with water from the springs of
                      the valley and makes it lie down on wooden frames. Then, the dough is cut
                      with a knife from the “cutters”, according to the desired size and dried with
                      advanced machinery.

                      Until the end of the eighteenth century, <span class="mention food" about="pasta" id="3p-128">pasta</span> was consumed without any

                      (that in the Mediterranean Countries soon found fertile soil) slowly were

                        can slightly increase the dose to 100 g.
