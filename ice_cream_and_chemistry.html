      <p>There is perhaps no fonder childhood memory than the local <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-3">ice cream</span> truck driving through the neighborhood, music blaring from its tinny speakers, beckoning all to partake of its frosty delights. But <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-4">ice cream</span> is not just for kids. <b><span class="mention place" about="USA" id="ic3-5" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">U.S.</span> residents consume 1.5 billion gallons of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-6">ice cream</span> each year; that’s roughly 5 gallons (19 liters) per person!</b> The <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-7">ice cream</span> we all enjoy is the result of years of experimentation involving&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;<i>chemistry!</i></p>

      <h3><span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-8">Air</span> is Important!</h3>
      <p>If you have ever made <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-9">ice cream</span>, you already know what goes into it, ingredients such as <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-900">milk</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-10">cream</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-11">sugar</span>. But there is one main ingredient that you may not have thought about, probably because you can’t see it&mdash;<i><span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-12">air</span></i>.</p>
      <p>Why is <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-13">air</span> so important? If you have ever had a bowl of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-14">ice cream</span> melt, and then refroze it and tried to eat it later, it probably did not taste very good. If you set a whole carton of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-15">ice cream</span> on the table and let it melt, the volume of the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-16">ice cream</span> would simply go down. <b><span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-17">Air</span> makes up anywhere from 30% to 50% of the total volume of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-18">ice cream</span>.</b></p>

      </div>
      <p>To get an idea of the effect of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-21">air</span> on <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-22">ice cream</span>, think of <span class="mention food" about="whippedCream" id="ic3-23">whipped cream</span>. If you whip <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-24">air</span> into <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-25">cream</span>, you get <span class="mention food" about="whippedCream" id="ic3-26">whipped cream</span>. <span class="mention food" about="ic3-27">Whipped cream</span> has a different texture and taste than <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-28">plain cream</span>. <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-29">Plain cream</span> tastes sweeter than <span class="mention food" about="whippedCream" id="ic3-30">whipped cream</span>. Just like <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-31">ice cream</span> without <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-32">air</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-33">pure cream</span> has a sickly, overly sweet taste. This is because the structure of a substance can have a big effect on how it tastes, and that the structure often controls the rate at which <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic3-34">flavor molecules</span> are released into the mouth. The larger the structure (<span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-35">ice cream</span>, in this case), the longer it takes for the <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic3-36">flavor molecules</span> to be released. <span class="mention component" about="flavour" id="ic3-37">Flavor molecules</span> that trigger receptors on the mouth and tongue.</p>
      <p>The amount of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-38">air</span> added to <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-39">ice cream</span> is known as overrun. If the volume of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-40">ice cream</span> is doubled by adding <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-41">air</span>, then the overrun is 100%, which is the maximum allowable amount of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-42">air</span> that can be added to commercial <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-43">ice cream</span>. The less expensive brands usually contain more <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-44">air</span> than the premium brands. One side effect of adding a lot of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-45">air</span> to <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-46">ice cream</span> is that it tends to melt more quickly than <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-47">ice cream</span> with less <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-48">air</span>.</p>
      <p>The amount of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-49">air</span> also has a huge effect on the density of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-50">ice cream</span>. A gallon (3.8 liters) of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-51">ice cream</span> must weigh at least 4.5 pounds, making the minimum density 0.54 gram per milliliter. Better brands have higher densities&mdash;up to 0.9 grams per milliliter. The next time you visit a grocery store, compare cheaper and more expensive brands by holding a carton in each hand&mdash;you should be able to notice a difference. Then read the net weight on the label to confirm your observation. Due to the high <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-52">fat</span> content of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-53">ice cream</span>, however, and because <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-54">fat</span> is less dense than <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-55">water</span>, any <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-56">ice cream</span> will always be less dense than any aqueous solution, otherwise you would not be able to make <span class="mention food" about="rootBeerFloats" id="ic3-57">root beer floats</span>!</p>
      <p><b><span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-58">Ice cream</span> is an emulsion&mdash;a combination of two liquids that don't normally mix together. Instead, one of the liquids is dispersed throughout the other.</b> In <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-59">ice cream</span>, liquid particles of <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-60">fat</span>&mdash;called <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-61">fat globules</span>&mdash;are spread throughout a mixture of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-62">water</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-63">sugar</span>, and <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic3-64">ice</span>, along with <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-65">air bubbles</span> (Fig. 1). If you examine <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-66">ice cream</span> closely, you can see that the structure is porous. A typical <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-67">air</span> pocket in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-68">ice cream</span> will be about one-tenth of a millimeter across. The presence of <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-69">air</span> means that <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-70">ice cream</span> is also a foam. Other examples of foams are <span class="mention food" about="whippedCream" id="ic3-71">whipped cream</span>, <span class="mention food" about="marshmallow" id="ic3-72">marshmallows</span>, and <span class="mention food" about="meringue" id="ic3-73">meringue</span> (as in <span class="mention food" about="lemonMeringuePie" id="ic3-74">lemon meringue pie</span>).</p>

      <h3><span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-780">Sugar</span> and <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-790">Fat</span></h3>
      <p><span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-80">Milk</span> naturally contains <span class="mention component" about="lactose" id="ic3-81">lactose</span>, or <span class="mention component" about="milkSugar" id="ic3-82">milk sugar</span>, which is not very sweet. <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-83">Ice cream</span> makers need to add a lot more <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-84">sugar</span> than you probably realize&mdash;usually <span class="mention component" about="sucrose" id="ic3-85">sucrose</span> or <span class="mention component" about="glucose" id="ic3-86">glucose</span>. Cold tends to numb the taste buds, making them less sensitive. So more <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-87">sugar</span> needs to be added to produce the desired effect at the low temperatures in which <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-88">ice cream</span> is usually served. If you taste <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-89">ice cream</span> at room temperature it will taste overly sweet. You may have noticed this same effect with carbonated <span class="mention food" about="softDrink" id="ic3-90">soft drinks</span>. If consumed warm, they taste sickly sweet. In parts of the world where <span class="mention food" about="softDrink">soft drinks</span> are normally consumed warm, there is less added <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-91">sugar</span>. If these same <span class="mention fod" about="softDrink" id="ic3-92">soft drinks</span> were served cold, they would not taste sweet enough.</p>
      <p>A big reason why <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-93">ice cream</span> tastes so good is because of its high <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-94">fat</span> content. Unless it is labeled as light, low-<span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-95">fat</span> or non-<span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-96">fat</span>, <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-97">ice cream</span> must contain at least 10% <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-98">fat</span>, and this <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-99">fat</span> must come from <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-100">milk</span>. (You cannot use <span class="mention food ingredient" about="lard" id="ic3-101">lard</span> when making <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-102">ice cream</span>!) Before <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-103">milk</span> is homogenized, a thick layer of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-104">cream</span> rises to the top. This <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-105">cream</span> has a high <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-106">fat</span> concentration&mdash;up to 50%&mdash;and supplies most of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-107">fat</span> in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-108">ice cream</span>.</p>
      <p><b>Premium <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-109">ice creams</span> may have up to 20% <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-110">fat</span>, which gives it a velvety, rich texture. Reduced <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-111">fat</span> <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-112">ice cream</span> does not taste as good as the real thing, and tends to lack the creamy texture.</b> Although <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-113">fat</span> is frequently vilified, it has its purpose. Most foods that taste delicious probably contain <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-114">fat</span>. <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-115">Fat</span> fills you up, so you don’t have to eat as much to feel full.</p>
      <p>The problem with using <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-116">fat</span> as an ingredient in any food is that it doesn’t mix well with a lot of other substances. <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-117">Fat</span> is nonpolar, meaning positive and negative charges within the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-118">fat</span> molecule are equally dispersed. A polar substance, such as <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-119">water</span>, has separate regions of positive and negative charge&mdash;one end of a polar molecule has a partial positive charge, and the other end has a partial negative charge. Polar and nonpolar substances do not mix. Just like <span class="mention food ingredient" about="oil" id="ic3-120">oil</span> floats to the top of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-121">water</span>, the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-122">fat</span> content in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-123">ice cream</span> has a tendency to separate out, as well.</p>

      <h3>Keeping It All Together</h3>
      <p>Because <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-125">ice cream</span> is an emulsion, you would expect that the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-126">fat</span> droplets that are present in the mixture would separate after some time, similar to a bottle of salad dressing in which the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="oil" id="ic3-127">oil</span> separates from the rest of the dressing. When you shake up a bottle of salad dressing, the two parts come together.  But after a few minutes, they begin to separate. That’s because the <span class="mention food ingredient" about="oil" id="ic3-128">oil</span> droplets interact with one another, a process called coalescence.</p>
      <p>In the case of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-129">milk</span>, each <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-130">fat</span> droplet is coated with a layer of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-1301">milk</span> <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic3-131">proteins</span> that prevents the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-132">fat</span> droplets from interacting with one another. These <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-133">milk</span> <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic3-134">proteins</span> act as <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic3-1341">“emulsifiers”</span>&mdash; substances that stabilize emulsions and allow the liquid droplets present in the emulsion to remain dispersed, instead of clumping together. Because these <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-135">milk</span> <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic3-136">proteins</span> have a nonpolar side, and because like dissolves like, the nonpolar sides of the <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic3-137">proteins</span> are attracted to the nonpolar <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-138">fat</span> globules. This is good in <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-139">milk</span>, but not so good in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-140">ice cream</span>, in which the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-141">fat</span> droplets should coalesce to trap <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-142">air</span>.</p>
      <p>So another <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic3-1421">emulsifier</span> is added to allow the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-143">fat</span> droplets to coalesce. This <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic3-1431">emulsifier</span> replaces <span class="mention food ingredient" about="milk" id="ic3-144">milk</span> <span class="mention component" about="protein" id="ic3-145">proteins</span> on the surface of the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-146">fat</span> droplets, leading to a thinner membrane, which is more likely to coalesce during whipping. A common <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic3-1461">emulsifier</span> is <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic3-147">lecithin</span>, found in <span class="mention food ingredient" about="eggYolk" id="ic3-148">egg yolks</span>. <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic3-149">Lecithin</span> is a generic term that refers to a group of molecules that consist of long chains of fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule, along with choline and a phosphate group (Fig. 2).</p>
      <img src="1450816912685.jpg" alt="Chemical structure of a type of lecithin called phosphatidylcholine">
      <p>Figure 2. Chemical structure of a type of <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic3-150">lecithin</span> called phosphatidylcholine</p>
      <p><span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic3-151">Lecithin</span> inserts itself between the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-152">fat</span> globules, which helps the <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-153">fat</span> globules to clump together and, as a result, the <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-154">air</span> bubbles that are present in the mix are trapped by this partially coalesced <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-155">fat</span>. This adds firmness and texture to the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-156">ice cream</span>, enabling it to retain its shape.</p>
      <p><b>Closely related to <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic3-157">emulsifiers</span> are <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic3-158">stabilizers</span>, which make the texture creamy.</b> <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic3-159">Stabilizers</span> have two roles: First, they prevent large crystal formation. In the presence of <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic3-160">stabilizers</span>, <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-161">ice cream</span> contains small <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic3-1610">ice</span> crystals that are easier to disperse and, therefore, they melt more slowly than larger <span class="mention food ingredient" about="ice" id="ic3-162">ice</span> crystals would. Second, <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic3-163">emulsifiers</span> act like a sponge by absorbing and then locking into place, any liquid in the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-164">ice cream</span>.</p>
      <p>Common <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic3-165">stabilizers</span> are <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="protein" id="ic3-166">proteins</span> such as <span class="mention food ingredient stabilizer" about="gelatin" id="ic3-167">gelatin</span> and <span class="mention food ingredient stabilizer" about="eggWhite" id="ic3-168">egg whites</span>. <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="guarGum" id="ic3-169">Guar gum</span>, <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="beanGum" id="ic3-170">locust bean gum</span>, and <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="xanthanGum" id="ic3-171">xanthan gum</span> can also be used. <b>Look for <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="carrageenan" id="ic3-172">carrageenan</span> and <span class="mention component stabilizer" about="sodiumAlginate" id="ic3-173">sodium alginate</span> on the ingredient label of your <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-174">ice cream</span> container.</b> Both are derived from <span class="mention food" about="seaweed" id="ic3-175">seaweed</span>! Without these <span class="mention component" about="stabilizer" id="ic3-176">stabilizers</span>, <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-177">ice cream</span> might look like a <span class="mention food" about="milkshake" id="ic3-178">milkshake</span>.</p>
      <p>Once you get all of the ingredients together in a mixture, you need to freeze the mixture to form <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-179">ice cream</span>. The dissolved solutes (mostly <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-180">sugar</span>) in the liquid portion of the mixture lower its freezing point. A freezing point depression of 1.86 °C occurs for every mole of solute added to 1 kilogram (kg) of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-181">water</span>. In other words, if you dissolve one mole of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-182">sugar</span> in 1 kg of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-183">water</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-184">water</span> will no longer freeze at 0 °C, but rather will freeze at –1.86 °C.</p>
      <p>Freezing point depression is a colligative property, meaning that the effect is observed regardless of the specific identity of the solute&mdash;all that matters is how many moles are dissolved. A typical batch of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-185">ice cream</span> will freeze at -3 °C (27 °F), due to the presence of all the dissolved solutes.</p>
      <p>A recent trend is <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-186">ice cream</span> made with <span class="mention component" about="liquidNitrogen" id="ic3-187">liquid nitrogen</span>.

Because the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-193">ice cream</span> freezes so quickly, the size of the crystals is small, resulting in a creamy texture.

      <h3>Types of <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-200">Ice Cream</span></h3>
      <p>Soft-serve <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-201">ice cream</span>, <span class="mention food" about="frozenCustard" id="ic3-202">frozen custard</span>, and <span class="mention food" about="frozenYogurt" id="ic3-203">frozen yogurt</span>. What is the difference?</p>
      <img src="1450817092948.jpg" alt="Ice cream cone">
      <p>Regular <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-204">ice cream</span> is typically served at –12 °C, while <b>soft-serve <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-205">ice cream</span></b> is served at –6 °C. This higher temperature is responsible for a softer product. Soft-serve <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-206">ice cream</span>, or soft serve, for short, contains less <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-207">fat</span> and more <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-208">air</span> than regular <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-209">ice cream</span>. Soft serve with insufficient <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-210">air</span> will have a yellowish color. The whiter the soft serve, the better the quality. As <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-211">ice cream</span> melts, you may have noticed this yellow color, which is simply the actual color of the ingredients used to make it. By adding <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-212">air</span> and fluffing it up, <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-213">ice cream</span> is better able to reflect white light, producing the white color. This is because the molecules in <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-214">ice cream</span> are large enough to reflect visible light (whereas, for example, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-215">water</span> molecules are too small to reflect visible light, because the size of a water molecule is smaller than the wavelengths of visible light).</p>
      <p><b><span class="mention food" about="frozenCustard" id="ic3-216">Frozen custard</span></b> differs from <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-217">ice cream</span> in that it contains at least 1.4% <span class="mention food ingredient" about="eggYolk" id="ic3-218">egg yolks</span>. The <span class="mention food ingredient" about="eggYolk" id="ic3-219">egg yolks</span> are made of <span class="mention component emulsifier" about="lecithin" id="ic3-220">lecithin</span>, an excellent <span class="mention component" about="emulsifier" id="ic3-221">emulsifier</span>. The result is a product with a smoother, creamier texture. Another difference is that custard contains much less <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-222">air</span> than <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-223">ice cream</span>. No <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-224">air</span> is mixed during its manufacture; instead, <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-225">air</span> is introduced during mechanical agitation as the <span class="mention food" about="frozenCustard" id="ic3-226">frozen custard</span> is being made. It is churned more slowly during its manufacture to minimize the amount of introduced <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-227">air</span>. Less <span class="mention component" about="air" id="ic3-228">air</span> leads to a thicker, denser product. <span class="mention food" about="frozenCustard" id="ic3-229">Frozen custard</span> is typically made fresh each day in the store. It is frozen quickly to prevent large crystals&mdash;of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="water" id="ic3-230">water</span>, <span class="mention component" about="lactose" id="ic3-231">lactose</span>, or any added <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-232">sugar</span>&mdash;from forming.</p>

      <p><b><span class="mention food" about="frozenYogurt" id="ic3-233">Frozen yogurt</span></b> is making a huge comeback these days, with self-serve <span class="mention food" about="frozenYogurt" id="ic3-234">frozen yogurt</span> shops offering a plethora of toppings popping up seemingly on every corner. <span class="mention food" about="frozenYogurt" id="ic3-235">Frozen yogurt</span> is viewed as a healthier alternative to <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-236">ice cream</span>, unless you top it off with a generous helping of <span class="mention food" about="gummyBear" id="ic3-237">gummy bears</span>! It does contain less <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-238">fat</span>, but that means you can eat more without feeling full. And to compensate for less <span class="mention component" about="fat" id="ic3-239">fat</span>, often a lot of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="sugar" id="ic3-240">sugar</span> is added. The biggest difference is that instead of <span class="mention food ingredient" about="cream" id="ic3-241">cream</span>, <span class="mention food ingredient" about="yogurt" id="ic3-242">yogurt</span> is added as the primary <span class="mention food ingredient" about="dairy" id="ic3-243">dairy product</span>. From there, the process is similar to making regular <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-244">ice cream</span>.</p>

        <li>Likely true, but may not be the first.</li>
        <li>False.</li>
        <li>Probably true.</li>
        <li>Possibly true, but there are several other equally compelling stories about the origin of the <span class="mention food" about="sundae" id="ic3-2851">sundae</span>.</li>
        <li>True.</li>
        <li>Story likely true, but may not be the first.</li>
        <li>Story likely true, but may not be the first.</li>
        <li>False. Don’t mistake the <span class="mention food" about="iceCream" id="ic3-286">ice cream sandwich</span> for the actual sandwich, which was invented by the Earl of Sandwich.</li>
